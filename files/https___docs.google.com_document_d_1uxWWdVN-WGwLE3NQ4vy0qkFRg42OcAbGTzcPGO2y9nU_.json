A refreshed brand identity will provide a new badge of belonging to our movement, help us tell the world what we stand for, and attract the attention of people who might never have noticed Mozilla before. It will grow our impact in many ways and launching it will be a milestone. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">Currently Mozilla has only a word mark (the word &quot;Mozilla&quot; in the Fira Sans font) and three colors to represent our brand in the world. That&#39;s no way to build a Rebel Alliance. Modern communication over mobile devices and using social portals requires a much harder working set of tools. Our organization, especially our global Mozilla communities, is eager to get their hands on a greater range of creative assets.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">Want to get involved in this effort?</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><ul class=\"c5 lst-kix_wd0a5adlna2k-0 start\"><li class=\"c4 c7\"><span>Let us know your thoughts by commenting on the Mozilla Identity project brief :</span><span><a class=\"c8\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/1p5fPGO&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1540482134026000\">&nbsp;</a></span><span class=\"c6\"><a class=\"c8\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/1p5fPGO&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1540482134026000\">http://bit.ly/1p5fPGO</a></span></li></ul><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><ul class=\"c5 lst-kix_wd0a5adlna2k-0\"><li class=\"c4 c7\"><span class=\"c1\">Show us what you think the Mozilla brand identity should look like.

It&rsquo;s more like remodeling, starting with a thorough assessment of the structure and its uses, now and in the future.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">Redefining the purpose of the house may require work on the foundation, the reconfiguration of walls, the addition of rooms. (That work is underway at Mozilla today.) Only then does the cosmetic work begin. The skin of the house - the brand expression - should not only reflect what stands beneath but suggest the experience people will have once they enter.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">An outdated brand expression won&rsquo;t attract many guests. A fresh one not only reinforces what the brand stands for but catches the eye of passersby who might never have paid attention. Over time with a well-crafted brand identity and expression, a single image distills everything that brand represents. Picture the Nike swoosh.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span>Our branded house needs to take into account our open source roots, our global footprint and appeal, and our desire to be one Mozilla. It should represent the spirit of our team and the products, technology, and people networks we stand up. We can do this! </span></p>","event_type":"Google Docs","source":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uxWWdVN-WGwLE3NQ4vy0qkFRg42OcAbGTzcPGO2y9nU/"}]
