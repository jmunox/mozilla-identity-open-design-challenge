[{"name":"Tim Murray (@Timotay)","date":"2016-10-04T12:59:35.000Z","content":"    <p>At the Brand New Conference in Nashville two weeks ago, we shared a snapshot of our progress and posted the designs here simultaneously. About 100 graphic designers and brand experts stayed after our presentation to share some snacks and their initial reactions.</p><p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHVBjdznUtA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p>Since then, we’ve continued to refine the work and started to gather feedback through quantitative testing, reflecting the great advice and counsel we’ve received online and in person. While we’ve continued to work on all four designs, Dino 2.0 and Flame&nbsp;show the most dramatic progress in response to feedback from conference attendees and Mozillians. We wanted to refine these designs prior to testing with broader audiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Meet Dino 2.1 </b></p><p>Our early work on Dino 2.0 focused on communicating that Mozilla is opinionated, bold, and unafraid to be different. Embodying the optimism and quirkiness of our culture, the minimalist design of this dinosaur character needed to extend easily to express our wide array of programs, communities, events, and initiatives. Dino 2.0 met the challenge.</p><p>On the other hand, the character’s long jaw reminded some commenters of an alligator and others of a red stapler. Colleagues also pointed out that it’s playfulness might undermine serious topics and audiences. Would we be less believable showing up to testify about encryption with a dino logo smiling from our briefcases?</p><p>So the dinosaur has continued to evolve. A hand-cut font helps shorten the jaw while a rounder outline shifts the mis-perception that we sell office supplies. After much debate, we also decided to make the more serious Mozilla portion – the upper part of the jaw – the core mark.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-489\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-490\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-491\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-492\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>Wait, does that doom the dino character? Not at all. </p><p>Since the bulk of our Mozilla brand expression occurs on screens, this shift would allow the animated dino to show an even wider range of emotions. Digitally, the core mark can come to life and look surprised, hungry, or &nbsp;annoyed as the situation warrants, without having those expressions show up on a printed report to Congress. And our communities would still have the complete Dino head to use as part of their own self expression.</p><p>Should Dino 2.1 end up as one of our finalists, we’ll continue to explore its expressions. Meanwhile, let us know what you think of this evolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Making Flame eternal. </b></p><p>The ink was still moist on Flame, our newest design direction, when we shared it in Nashville. We felt the flame metaphor was ideal for Mozilla, referencing being a torch-bearer for an equal, accessible internet, and offering a warm place for community to gather. Even so, would a newcomer seeing our name next to a traditional flame assume we were a religious organization? Or a gas company? We needed a flame that was more of the Web and more our own.</p><p>So we asked: what if our core mark was in constant motion — an eternal flame that represents and reinforces our purpose? Although we haven’t landed on the exact Flame or the precise font, we are on a better design path now.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/185292705?loop=1&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"820\" height=\"461\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-494\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-495\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-496\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-497\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Should the Flame make it into our final round, we will continue to explore different flame motions, shapes, and static resting states, along with a flexible design system.

We have also shared a survey to all Mozillians with similar questions plus a specific ask to flag any cultural bias. And since web developers are a key audience for us, we’ve extended the survey through the Mozilla Developer Network as well.</p><p>This research phase will provide additional data to help us select our final recommendation. It will help us discern, for instance, which of these four pathways resonates best with which segment of our audience. The findings will not be the only factor in our decision-making. Comments from the blog and live crit sessions, our 5-year strategic goals as an organization, and other factors will weigh into the decision.</p><p>We’ll share our top-level research findings and our rationale for proceeding as we go. Continued refinement will be our next task for the route(s) selected in this next round, so your insights and opinions are still as valuable as ever.</p><p>Thanks again to everyone who has taken the time to be a part of this review process.

This emediatly gives the viewer a good idea of what Mozilla does to a short extent. The font change is nice with a more universal style and animation could lead to great copy write campaigns.

I was reading a blog on corporate logo redesigns (<a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/</a>) some time back and looking at the examples it was clear to my that the most successful redesigns were the ones that managed to take something people recognize and update it just enough to make it look fresh and new. Generally I think the results for companies that decided to let more or less go of their previous identity were much less successful. It is positive that the dino’s lower jaw has been shortened (look less like a stapler) but I still think the design is way to minimalistic and needs to pay more homage to the old dino designs. It does simply not have enough character. The idea of only using the upper jaw is terrible as it really limits the ways the logo can be used. I know that minimalistic and flat design is everywhere but this is only the more of a reason to come up with something more complex as I think Dino 2.1 quickly could end up looking dated.</p> <p>Protocol is still good but as many pointed out the color is very different from your current colors.
