    "content": "    <p>Seven months since setting out to refresh the Mozilla brand experience, we’ve reached the summit. Thousands of emails, hundreds of meetings, dozens of concepts, and three rounds of research later, we have something to share. If you’re just joining this process, you can get oriented<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/designing-in-the-open/\"> here</a> and<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/now-were-talking/\"> here.</a></p><p>At the core of this project is the need for Mozilla’s purpose and brand to be better understood by more people. We want to be known as the champions for a healthy Internet. An Internet where we are all free to explore and discover and create and innovate without barriers or limitations. Where power is in the hands of many, not held by few. An Internet where our safety, security and identity are respected.</p><p>Today, we believe these principles matter more than ever. And as a not-for-profit organization, we’re uniquely able to build products, technologies, and programs that keep the Internet growing and healthy, with individuals informed and in control of their online lives.</p><p>Our brand identity – our logo, our voice, our design – is an important signal of what we believe in and what we do. And because we are so committed to ensuring the Internet is a healthy global public resource, open and accessible to everyone, we’ve designed the language of the Internet into our brand identity.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuLWXHgyEVw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>Today, we’re sharing our new logo and a proposed color palette, language architecture, and imagery approach. Remaining true to our intent to engage with the design and tech community throughout this open design process, we welcome your feedback on these elements as we build out our design guidelines.</p><p>Let’s go into a bit more detail on the components of our brand identity system, developed in collaboration with our exceptional London-based design partner johnson banks.</p><p><b>Our logo</b></p><p>Our logo with its nod to URL language reinforces that the Internet is at the heart of Mozilla. We are committed to the original intent of the link as the beginning of an unfiltered, unmediated experience into the rich content of the Internet.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-545\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_logo\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_logo.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_logo-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_logo-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_logo-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The font for the wordmark and accompanying copy lines is Zilla. Created for us by Typotheque in the Netherlands, Zilla is free and open to all.</p><p>Typotheque was an historic partner to Mozilla. They were the first type-foundry to release Web-based fonts, and Mozilla’s Firefox web browser was an early adopter of Web fonts. We chose to partner with Peter Bilak from Typotheque because of their deep knowledge of localization of fonts, and our commitment to having a font that includes languages beyond English. Prior to partnering with Typotheque, we received concepts and guidance from Anton Koovit and FontSmith.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-546\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2.jpg\" alt=\"johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2-600x434.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2-1000x723.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>Selected to evoke the Courier font used as the original default in coding, Zilla has a journalistic feel. It bucks the current convention of sans serif fonts. Anyone can create the Mozilla logo by typing and highlighting with the Zilla font, making the logo open and democratic. The black box surrounding the logo is a key building block of the design, and echoes the way we all select type in toolbars and programs.</p><p>Mozilla comes first in any application of the system, just as the protocol begins any internet journey. Copy lines, colors, and images all flow from that starting point, much like a web journey.</p><p><b>Our color palette</b></p><p>Our color palette, derived from the highlight colors used by Firefox and other web browsers, distinguishes our brand from its contemporaries. Color flows into our logo and changes according to the context in which the logo is used. As we develop our style guide, we’ll define color pairings, intensities, and guidelines.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-544\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p><b>Our language and language architecture</b></p><p>Copy lines to the right or below the logo hold core Mozilla messages.&nbsp; They also hold program, event, and team names — simplifying and unifying a multitude of different Mozilla activities. It will now be easier to know that something is “from” Mozilla and understand how our global initiatives connect and reinforce one another.</p><p>The system enables Mozilla volunteer communities across the globe to create their own identity by selecting color and choosing imagery unique to them. Meanwhile the core blocks of our system, bounding boxes and typography, will provide the consistency, making it clear that these communities are part of one Mozilla.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-543\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_architecture\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_architecture.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_architecture-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_architecture-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_architecture-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p><b>Our Imagery</b></p><p>As we looked at the elements of our brand identity, the concept of one image or icon standing for the whole of Mozilla, and the entirety of the Internet, seemed anachronistic. Since imagery is an important reflection of the diversity and richness of the Internet, however, we’ve made it an important component of our system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In digital applications, ever-changing imagery represents the unlimited bounty of the online ecosystem. Dynamic imagery allows the identity of Mozilla to evolve with the Internet itself, always fresh and new. Static applications of our identity system include multiple, layered images as if taken as a still frame within a moving digital experience.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-542\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>How might it work? We intend to invite artists, designers, and technologists to contribute to an imagery collective, and we’ll code curated GIFs, animations, and still images to flow into mozilla.org and and other digital experiences. Through this open design approach, we will engage new design contributors and communities, and make more imagery available to all under Creative Commons. We’re looking for input from creative communities to help shape and expand this idea.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-540\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will roll out the new brand identity in phases, much as we have with concepts in this open design process, so please be patient with our progress.

The example of MDN in the new identity still uses the dino, which suggests that the new identity still doesn’t have a good replacement icon.<br> * The example on the office wall reminds me of IE6’s About box.<br> * The Fira font still looks good with the new identity on mozilla.org. It seems to pair well with Zilla. We should keep using Fira – perhaps for more product-focused application; whereas Zilla could be for more activism/organisation-focused uses.<br> * If you make an example in red that says “This technology could fall into the right hands”, you’ll probably win me over.<br> * It isn’t *not*-Mozilla.<br> * The coloured versions of the logo remind me of Inverse.com.<br> * I want to like it.<br> * I hope I eventually like it.</p>     ",

In addition, the imagery in the rebranding is too reminiscent of the images used during AOL’s rebranding to Aol in the early 2010s, and when AOL rebranded, perception of the new logo was also quite negative, and worsened perception of the brand. So, in summary, the new Mozilla logo is already dated as a result of its surrounding imagery, and the company should seriously consider retooling the rebrand to remove the dated elements and incorporate a more timeless design, or scrap the logo altogether and start the design process from scratch, with a timeless design given priority over “artsy” designs. The design can still be simple, it just needs to be a more timeless design.</p>     ",

It won’t have me singing its praises. </p> <p>I liked the comment about the McDonald’s arches best. Everyone knows what that means. The Chevy bow tie.

Looks too much like an old-style typewriter, which I used too many years to find in the least bit attractive, but sometimes old becomes new again and the font will work over time, a favorite. </p> <p>I love that the protocol :// really fit the name mozilla to a T.  It is just genius; even while I’m not sure if, of itself, it can fill all the gaps you are wanting in a brand.  Time will tell.</p> <p>Also, not sure if it was intentional, or not, but I read the hand as making the sign of  “Ok”  as also making the symbol for “zero $$, or FREE” which definitely captures the spirit and intent of Mozilla to begin with. Another stroke of genius! If not, a stroke of my genius to see both things  ;)</p> <p>What I do not care for AT ALL is the color pallete: To begin with purplish-pink, orange and yellow are hideous colors to combine. I have no doubt that you will achieve what Denny’s Restaurant chain wanted when they chose this color scheme:  To get serviced-customers moving out of their restaurants quickly to make room for new customers.  These clashing colors, along with hard plastic seats, made people uncomfortable and made them all but run out of their restaurant after having eaten.  I don’t think this is Mozilla’s long term goal.   I fancy a palette which is more soothing over hours of viewing, and definitely something more pleasing to the eye. Something, perhaps, a bit more neutral without losing vibrancy in the processes.</p> <p>Of course, I am but one voice among many. I put in my two cents and look forward to what comes in hopes that it will be a process that continues to evolve and move forward until creators and contributors eventually arrive at the perfect combination of colors and symbols.</p>     ",

Perhaps Typotheque could come up with characters that would be “different enough” from the new font, to make it seem less like character code and a bit more differentiated.

I’m merely a hack.<br> But if you offset the :// in such a way, using an altogether different font<br> and setting it apart, maybe in a gradient color, the Logo would look<br> more pulled together and more cohesive.<br> I do believe the use of a separate font would, and in a smaller size than the rest of the name, would make the :ll less prominent.

Its easily recognized immediately all over the world and it says “USA” without even 1 letter on it, but now if we were to change even one item or color, suddenly people would be wondering who is that? We can change anything we want about our country, its policies and loyalties and attitudes  and governing bodies, but the flag that represents us does not change, imagine if it did…I guess what I’m trying to say here is simply ” If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” I like the original logo just fine and can spot it anywhere so why not just leave it alone? Would you recognize “Uncle Sam” in a new outfit of designer clothes and colors? I think not.  Best of luck in your endeavors  to get yourselves rediscovered and known again.</p>     ",

I have been using the products from the Mosaic/Netscape days.  I have assumed the name came from the combination of Mosaic and Godzilla and that the Godzilla influence had to do with the little original gecko mascot thingy (maybe making him seem tougher?) Anyways I believe you need to provide some historical context so the world will actually have a better understanding of your role. I find it difficult and I have had some background using several of the products you have developed over the years. Differentiating things like Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Gecko, Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey are difficult for the common user. Your quest to rebrand may be a good one but it really doesn’t matter if the public does not understand what you do in the first place. To me Mozilla is the strong underlying foundation that has developed and supports other products.  As such the image needs to be strong, functional and stable. To me associating multiple images to the name does not meet that goal. In fact, it weakens an identity that is already not well understood.<br> I rely on Firefox as my browser and Thunderbird as my email client.  As far as Mozilla is concerned I want to know that the foundation will continue to support and improve these flagship products.  The name and image need to inspire confidence in the strength of this supporting foundation.  Visually I liked the impression of the Moz://a idea but I agree that this representation of the name comes with some major drawbacks. I don’t know how you will be able to overcome these problems outside your own products.  Maybe the Moz://a portion should only be provided as a graphic with an overlay (below?) with the real text.  Again, this will become a problem as the history of the name is forgotten.  Without knowing Mozilla who will recognize where Moz://a actually came from?</p>     ",

When Mozilla had the dino logo, did the people searched the ‘dino’ on the internet? then why is everyone is going mad over this?<br> ‘Moz://a’ is the ‘logo’ while ‘Mozilla’ is the ‘name’. Please!!! Nobody asked you to enter ‘Moz://a’ in the address bar! it’s not a name damn it! it’s the logo!<br> And for god’s sake! this is not replacement for firefox logo! this is the logo for Mozilla.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>Love it! … for the most part. That includes the excellent mottos/ catch phrases re what you stand for, and your campaign to popularize it. It is interesting that you have had to explain that none of this affects the Fox logo, that it won’t go away, and that Firefox is only pasrt of Mozilla. That shows the need to make the difference clear.  I really like the new font and logo. Some critics/ comments have good points, though some of it is over my head. I don’t know code, or the history of internet design as used in the 90’s… I think that will not be a big issue for most people, especially the general public. I assume you are mainly reaching out to the general public, and are seeking to inform and gain support from them.  Though I have no formal training in it, I think I have a decent eye for design.  I like your design changes, though I am concerned some of it is too “busy”. I’m sure you’ll make some adjustments as needed.
