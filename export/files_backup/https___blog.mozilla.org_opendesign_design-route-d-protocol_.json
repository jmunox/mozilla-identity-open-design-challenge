There are so many blue logos and brand identities that it would be a shame to see Mozilla absolved into that. Red and white while still not terribly original is more unique. It also retains some of the original brand which makes the difference less jarring to those not accustomed to change.

I know lots of folks like it (they get it), but it leaves out those who don’t (and those who won’t) and the legibility/scannability suffers as a result. That may not seem like a big deal, but keep in mind that aside from Apple, we are largely going to be compared to other wordmarks.</p> <p>3) There is a boldness to this — in terms of its simplicity and its layout — that makes a statement that the others confusingly stumble on. We should have an opinion and be a presence. This should emit confidence, fearlessness, and determination. That’s our presence.</p> <p>Clearly, I don’t like the others (at all), for a variety of reasons. This is the only one that seems close. Caveat: I do believe that our current brand identity needs to evolve into this one, not recreate it wholesale. There’s nothing wrong with the dinosaur itself, nothing wrong with the red itself.

We could even use the same or a similar font as we use now – why not? A great opportunity for a rebranding with some continuity. </p> <p>* The colour of the letters “moz” should therefore be all the same</p> <p>* As Mike Kaply said, how about red for the “moz” and “a”, and black for the “://”? </p> <p>* We should experiment with hacking the font to make the “//” a bit more vertical, thereby both hinting at the “://” protocol separator, but also making the wordmark easier to read as text.</p> <p>* We should also experiment with non-square colon dots; extending both vertically might make it a bit more “i”-like. </p> <p>* We could make the URL “moz://a” work in Firefox to take you to the Mozilla website, or an easter egg, or somewhere cool.</p> <p>Gerv</p>     ",

Tending more towards the developer market (using colours and font similar to other companies). So while it is safe and in the comfort zone of comparability perhaps to distinguish it better a different font could be used and variation on colour choice. Colours have quite strong reactions for people, especially those with headaches, (yellow for urgency &amp; pain, orange for warmth, red for passion, purple for prestige, blue for calm, turquoise for contemplation, green for nature &amp; particularly easy on the eye etc). The effect of colours on the eye is not gospel as many people have different visual capabilities (black&amp;blue vs. white&amp;gold dress is an interesting example).  So while the lizard eye was catchy at first and the rainbows and fluros of the other logos could be fun to glance at the eyes quite often tend to strain in pain from staring at them or trying to read them. especially with mixed patterns which produce the optical blurs and scotoma normally related to such designs. This would be the one I would tend towards, however the Escher M was also a good reference.</p>     ",

The darker/lighter color use is also amazing for the concept, but maybe these shades of blue aren’t the best, at least for this font. I loved the flag use!

Though I’m not crazy about the colors, or the colon and back slashes it makes it look a little incomplete. The darker shade of blue is reminiscent of Facebook. Mozilla is mostly known for the Firefox web browser. Why not try incorporating its color scheme into the logo. I feel like the contrast of the darker blue with Firefox’s orange would really make it pop, and give it a more playful, and youthful appearance. The monochrome blue color scheme has become such an overused one, its to safe. adding another color especially one that is a complimentary to blue would be beneficial to the overall design.</p>     ",

It’s not feeling very inspired, but at least you would know the name of the company and not have a seizure induced like some of the other needlessly busy logo options. It’s very very safe. Might want to consider why a rebranding is even necessary? I don’t think most companies with a recognizable logo need to rebrand at all. Seems like a waste of time and money. What does the research really say about the lasting impact of a rebrand vs the cost of the design and roll out? (let’s find real research on this). My own company (a social-service nonprofit) just paid a forture to rebrand and ended up with the most generically useless logo that replaced a nearly 100 year old highly recognizable one. Might have been better to have an update on the old logo rather than scrap it. Might not apply here, due to the young age of Mozilla, but the point is that what’s wrong with the old text?</p>     ",

But what is the price of these two merits?<br> A) Even if the :// proves to work in the future of the internet, this only feels applicable with Mozilla being “that company that makes Firefox”. Protocol has no variants for Mozfest, or Maker Party, or Open systems, or even national branches; it just has tacked on emoji. This is symptomatic of the greater problem that Protocol has no versatility.</p> <p>B) The design language of clean, minimal text with non-threatening colors is marketing convention at its finest. The problem with that is it gives the impression of Mozilla being conventional and corporate. Sure, acting professional is a reasonable thing, but Mozilla isn’t about being another tech company. To me Mozilla stands as a guardian of what the internet was meant to be, and a symbol of how non-profits can impact our everyday lives. Also, anything that reminds me of HP Enterprise’s non-logo is a black mark in my book.</p> <p>C) It’s BORING, I’m looking at the shirt samples and the first thing I think is, “I cannot imagine people actually wanting to buy this”.

    "content": "       <p>Hi</p> <p>I really like this one.  In its long form it is clever, in its short form it is a logo, and can be used as a statement with the addition of a slogan or a project name.</p> <p>It is flexible in its application and would work well in a range of colours (far too much blue in the concepts shown).  Even with the logo, it could be used in body text to refer to M:// (crumbs, I am using it already!), or even as a shortened web link in marketing materials.</p> <p>For those that do not know us, it links well with what we do and the products and services we produce.  For those that do know us, it screams out “give it your best shot – we are making the web better!”.</p> <p>The logo has its casual use in its short form, but even that works well in a more corporate sense.  It will work well on the printed page, but also on branded material.  I also like the typewritten build effect for videos – looks great.</p> <p>The best of the bunch and one that I (as a contributor) can identify with and would be proud to use.  I look forwards to it being a sticker on my laptop soon. :-)</p>     ",

The simple shapes should also make this logo easily extensible for special uses. While the other logos are quite interesting, I don’t think they are as realistically useable as this one.</p>     ",

It is very hard to make a wordmark into a square image for favicons and things like that. I don’t like the M:// square image that was provided because it will be difficult to get people to associate M:// with Mozilla.<br> Another thing that I would like to see in this logo is the Mozilla red.
