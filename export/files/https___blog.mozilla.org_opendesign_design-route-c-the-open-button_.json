How could we communicate ‘open’, quickly and simply? Could we find a current symbol or pictogram of ‘open’ and adapt it to our needs? There is one, and it’s around us almost every day…</p><p>This design direction stems from the narrative theme called Choose Open.</p></div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 25\"><div class=\"section\"><div class=\"layoutArea\"><div class=\"column\"><p><strong>Choose Open </strong></p><p>The future of the Internet can be open, or closed. We choose open. We choose an internet that is equal and accessible by default. Open to ideas, open to collaboration, open to everyone. But it isn’t a choice we can make alone. An open web is something we all have to choose together. And it involves many other choices. e tools we use. e products we support. e way we behave online. Those choices can be complex, but the guiding principle should always be simple.

The versions with the outer glows and more intricate renderings fall short and dilute effectiveness overall (Maker Party and Brazil mark). </p> <p>A few things that bother me… the logo is based of an existing  symbol and the word I think of when seeing this symbol is Power, not open. It also feels limited in terms of scalability compared to some of the other concepts.

Though some other concepts are really great design, I feel that this one has the most potential, and steers towards classic rather than trendy.

The flexibility of the icon is great, it’s got a slight retro feel, and can be evolved to stand through a long period of time.</p> <p>I’m not 100% sold on the colours, I find them too primary and unrefined.

You cannot argue about uniqueness in context speaking about how the pictogram is a metaphor of freedom when standing alone it cannot communicate the subject at all. I find it to be a very enthusiastic thought to visualize freedom of choice. Even more so when after looking at it again and again it looks actually more closed than open, the highlighted part being some sort of gate or door. If you’re about to merchandise it like it’s showcased here the logo got to speak for itself. You cannot just throw something into peoples heads and “hope” that it works. This would need gradual disconnection from the logo type over quite some time in my opinion.<br> The color choice feels poor and not really thought about (Is blue open because it is the color of the sky? Why is the accented part pink then? Is it the wonder of freedom?). People might think colors are only personal choice but in fact there’s a whole lot more to them.</p>     ",
