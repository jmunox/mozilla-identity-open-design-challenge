I’m not even going to waste my time on the other ones they are so terrible.</p> <p>A lot of these logos remind me of the huge fail that Corsair went about in redoing their logo to some rambunctious slut tattoo look-alike. What happened? People hated it. It drove away customers. So they rebalanced the old, classy design and made it even better after that, and that is what they will use for years going forward.</p> <p>This one…. if you can maybe simplify it a bit more and make it so the logo adapts well to different countries I could see this being a winner. But you need taste, and you will be making a lot of logos for each country. It will take the most work. But it’s the only one here that is even remotely feasible to me. </p> <p>You guys could learn a lot from Corsair’s huge mistakes in creating a new logo. It can honestly kill your business if you are not careful. A few of these logos are absolutely demoralizing for current customers. As in I would immediately get a download add-on to change the logo if you used these logos for Firefox.</p>     ",

Whether you add on or reduce the main logo in a particular context, the core metaphors of playfulness and adaptability  (i.e. tinkering, maker–spaces and experimentation) hold up. The simplicity of these components, more than other directions’, invites experimentation—even when in relatively stolid configurations. </p> <p>Slight caveat: All the above was about the squarish configurations.

I may have too much free time on my hands.<br> 2) The uneven baseline unsettles me. As I get to the end of the word I feel like I’m about to slide out of my chair.

Think of Disney, NASA, Coca Cola, FedEx, Ebay, Subway, Visa, Facebook, Ubuntu, Panasonic, CNN, Kellogs, Canon etc etc. The list is endless but they’re all lead by typography and the colour scheme is supporting act. I’d say FAR more effort needs to be put into the typography of this design if it is to be successful. </p> <p>On a positive note there is absolutely MASSIVE potential here. It’s a modern, striking idea that speaks to the core values of Mozilla. It’s actually quite exciting to think of how good this design could be. It’s far more impactful, deep and subtle than the blunt simplicity of the ‘zilla eye’ or the inward geek naval gazing of the m:// design. And the others don’t bare mention as they’re not even contenders. </p> <p>Done correctly the square letter arrangement has the potential to become very iconic (in the true sense of the word). That in turn will support the other country specific designs you’ve proposed above. </p> <p>If this design could be iterated and refined you are likely onto a winner that could be pretty transformative for the brand but there is a very fine line to walk to get there.</p>     ",

A logo doesn’t need to be read as long as it’s recognized. While I feel like the vibe of this logo reeks of “Olympics”, if used properly within a well-conceptualized brand it could really create a unique and modern experience for us as users by being active and integrated throughout all products and applications, as opposed to just being a stamp or a character that lives in a little logo bubble.</p> <p>I believe it could use some attention on the color end of things. It works particularly well when it’s monochromatic, or has 2-3 colors (for example the yellow t-shirt design shown above). Structurally, it’s already very complex, and the complexity of a wide spectrum of colors does make it visually noisy as some people have pointed out already. Maybe it exists “color-less” unless called upon or animated?</p> <p>This one has my vote for the final choice.</p>     ",

This one is modern – and importantly for today’s world – completely adaptable for all forms of online and print media.  The ‘square’ version is perfect for icons, while the ‘unrolled’ version works as a masthead logo.  I also love the concepts where it integrates into a larger, more muted background pattern – this gives infinite possibilities, not just for T-shirts but also page design.  Yes the rainbow palette does have a bit of Olympics/hippy feel to it which makes it hard to convey the sense of a serious business-minded enterprise, but I feel the colours can be tweaked to mitigate this.  Most of the iconic logos (Google, Microsoft, ebay) stop at 4 colours, and there’s good reason for that.  I would love to see this design taken further.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>Far and way the best design among the seven. Fresh, innovative, evokes/suggests diversity, digital fingerprint, chip circuitry, pathways, labyrinth, and spells out Mozilla once you spend enough time with it. I’ve been designing logos professionally since 1980, and this is a winner: it will present well around the world, it is a symbol that transcends language while spelling out Mozilla, but with a subtle nod to the characters in languages other than English; by its technical, colorful geometric nature it will it will be able to show off modern digital technology superbly; it will absolutely stand the test of time; and it puts a fresh face on the brand, I believe it would tell the brand story well and position it among or above the industry leaders.</p> <p>The other designs are, with all due respect, off-target, amateurish, derivative or just plain ugly. This applies to their concept, structure and color scheme.</p> <p>My opinion of each design, in order of how they are shown:<br> 1. Ugly. Derivative or rip off of World PBS channel with shapes and colors. Also makes me think: clunky, amateurish type handling, African Safari / primitive tribal, wild cat eye stalking me…<br> 2. Winner<br> 3. Maybe has potential, but hate the garish colors, and who cares about  products’ universal operational iconography anymore? Boring. Seen it done hundreds of times.<br> 4. Meh. As wordmarks go, it’s clever, like the colors and classic typography, but as the signature image to tell your brand’s story, it fails. Too plain, too “coding is cool”, or “hey look, our logo suggests a URL”…again, meh. Also not fresh, distinctive or modern.<br> 5. Cool, I like this second best, but it totally rips off Microsoft’s Zune MP3 player (the logo was done by JDK, a company I used to work for) and it’s not as attractive with this black color scheme. And you know how Zune turned out. Also rips off Melbourne Australia’s identity, but not nearly as beautiful.<br> 6. Horrid. Ugh. Looks like an amateur played around in some paint program or Adobe Illustrator in 1987. Slightly clever as an exploration of the m shape, but do we need to conjure up visuals synonymous with the retro sensibilities of Roy Lichtenstein, MC Escher and the days of early laser printers and visible halftone dots? Not for a forward moving brand.<br> 7. WTF. A logo? Clever but way too obscure. Colors are too hipster organic. Also suggests house of cards, unstable, precarious, contrived.</p> <p>Thanks for the opportunity to rant. I spend my days poring through logo design books and online logo showcases when researching a new identity. I am passionate about logo design and I really like option 2. The explorations of how it would be treated on shirts, swag, sub brands, the different color schemes, the animation, etc. are proof of its versatility, adaptability and it stays fresh in each iteration. The rest are garbage. Odd that there is such a chasm between these options.</p>     ",

Primarily because I feel like the others crucially miss some sort of mark in terms of what they focus on or what emotions they convey, especially on the feeling of openness or their capacity to carry messages with a positive and/or emotive tone.</p> <p>I feel that this one has the most capacity to engage with people who might not otherwise know who Mozilla is too; there feels like a very inviting nature about it – it’s not static, it’s not uniform and it’s comprised of many different parts. It feels like a very apt metaphor for values of openness and the internet. This system allows for a lot of flexibility to take the branding beyond the main logo, while maintaining some sort of underlying visual concept that allows the organisation to be consistent and recognised. </p> <p>I also like the fact that it doesn’t emphasise technology as much compared to other ideas – not that technology is important or not important to Mozilla, but because I think that to focus on technology can carry risks and miss more important points of an organisation. Because technology is invisible to so many people, making it a big focus risks seeming businessy or developer-centric, and it avoids opportunities to convey what I think would be the more distinctive, emotive and engaging aspects of an organisation, which is the use of the technology itself. So I like how this concept has this geometric structure can convey a sense of technology, but as more of a nod or contextual detail rather than giving technology itself a theme entirely on it’s own or a central focus.</p> <p>The Memphis-esque rainbow colour scheme for the default logo is definitely not going to stand the test of time, but that is something that can easily change. I’m not entirely certain about how other aesthetic aspects would stand the test of time but I think it’s basics – the use of interlocking geometric shapes it’s a very good starting point, and the geometric simplicity certainly helps lend it to possibilities to develop in the future as needs and design trends change.</p> <p>Like others have said, I’m concerned about the recognisability of the the current compact/square logo at a distance. For me, it’s not simply because the lines create too much detail, just the lack of a distinctive overall silhouette/form. There possibly needs to be something to visually stabilise it so it avoids looking just like an isolated part of a tessellating pattern.</p>     ",
