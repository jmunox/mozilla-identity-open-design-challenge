I feel this would work better integrated into another theme, perhaps “For All.” As a stand alone theme, it does seem more like Mozilla is doing the work of the Internet Defense League or Fight for the Future. While Mozilla supports these groups, as evidenced by the Battle for the Net Website main page, Mozilla doesn’t stick to just that idea. You also make products and services.</p>     ",

While the policy and advocacy teams at Mozilla played a strong role helping to bring about net neutrality, you’re right that we also produce technologies that help form Internet standards and we put our philosophy into practice with Firefox and other products. Your thought about integrating some ideas from one theme into another will be our next step in this process. Thanks for being along on this journey with us.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>This is an aspect of who we are that is really important to me. I agree with Gene’s comment above that this is probably not the only thing we would want to emphasize (and the word “protector” could mean many things), but there is a general theme here that I like: the Internet is in trouble, and we are a force to help turn that around. </p> <p>In order to engage with people, they need to understand what’s wrong about the Internet today. I believe that’s the only way to engage people who would otherwise not care. (Themes around “for good”, “love”, etc are feel-good themes that won’t truly engage those who aren’t already deeply involved in the subject.) Normal human beings need to see why we’re fighting for the open web, and it needs to be explained in a way that makes sense. Then, Mozilla should be seen as a force of good in that fight. </p> <p>There’s a balance here between acting as a police against the “bad” and demonstrating though leadership and forward movement towards the “good”. That’s why I think “The Protector” is a theme that is best combined with something that also brings the positive/future-facing aspects of what we do (products, services, solutions to real people). </p> <p>Keep ’em coming! :)</p>     ",

Our brand identity and communications needs to strike a balance between defining a problem the average person knows little about, and describing how we’re making it better.

Good point about finding not only universal words but a universal visual language to work globally.

It becomes just a slogan instead of having personal meaning.</p> <p>Things like “protest” and some of the organizations shown may also turn off people who are more establishment (like myself).
