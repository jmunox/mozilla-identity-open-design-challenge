Staring is an inherently confrontational act, and it also carries a lot of negative connotations (surveillance a la 1984, Sauron, etc. that people have mentioned). While I’m not a fan of the whole “reminds me of ____” comments because everything can remind anyone of anything based on experience, it’s hard to get around that idea of discomfort when someone stares at you. That one is pretty universal. I’m just not sure it strikes the right tone for the company.</p> <p>While trying to hold on to your history is a good thing, this feels so drastically different that I’m not sure people would make that connection. There just isn’t enough of that equity retained. For instance, once the eye gets broken out into the character with the hands, it loses the context it once had and becomes something else entirely.</p> <p>I applaud the stones behind this one. Perhaps with some tweaks to the applications or perhaps the color palette (I’d also like to see more integration between the harsh angles of the letters and the circular eye), this could be a really unexpected solution.</p>     ",

It’s simple, direct, bold. It’s the opposite of sprawling, the opposite of ineffectual. (Which, if it wasn’t clear in my earlier comment, are two pieces of baggage Mozilla needs to shed. Shed… like an outgrown reptile skin!) The opposite of the governing-board-meeting-at-the-local-food-co-op vibe that plagues all the other 6 designs. (Trying to please everyone and offend no one – and winding up accomplishing nothing. I’ve been to those meetings.) And it has a Godzilla reference to boot. More Godzilla please. Mo’zilla. Is it bad-ass? YES IT IS. Do you want Mozilla to be more bad-ass, more focused, more effective? I sure do.</p> <p>The reptilian eye is really scaring people huh? A random perfectly-nice person piloting their SUV down a street is way more scary to me and poses the far greater danger. Yellow and black means caution, does it? Sure, to people who spend their lives obeying signs. Just think of it as a vagina then.</p> <p>The guy who “surveils” you is going to arrive at your doorstep sporting a lizard eye? No, he will sneak in using a smiling, friendly-looking Google Doodle. Mozilla has already erred by trying to out-Google Google when they need to be not just an alternative Google but the anti-Google. (Let Facebook out-Google Google.)</p> <p>This logo would make people take notice and re-think Mozilla. As being focused and competent and having some cojones.

Hard black on strong yellow also harks to construction themes, you know, Caterpillar, Komatsu, etc, which suggests hard, honest, work, not pushing financial numbers around. </p> <p>The thick lettering is a wonderful contrast to the current fad of super-thin typography, and in which IMO is going to look very dated very fast. As the iphone sinks, so will its themes. This is definitely a standout, forward looking, new-definition design language for the FUTURE, not the past. Contrast that with the “safe space” -style ethnic theme also on display which in my opinion is the worst on display, closely followed by the origami which is soooo 2014. </p> <p>The only question is the eye. I like it a lot, but many will say it reminds them of big brother. When it blinks, I think it actually looks quite friendly, like a wink, and that’s good, but it will face some controversy. Perhaps it needs to be shown that it’s a “who watches the watchmen” kind of eye in which case it would be great. </p> <p>Best best logo I have seen like, for years.</p>     ",

Some seem too modern/Picasso esque, others feel like a child would have drawn them, and as noted for the ‘eye’, I too think it is ‘Big Brotherish’.  While modernizing a brand in a Windows 10 world is unfortunately a ‘must do’, perhaps such a radical shift is not the best course of action (Windows 8 Start ring a bell?).  Maybe a more polished/updated current logo would be in order.  That way, it retains its familiarity with established users/contributors while still having the ability to draw new interest.  If I had any artistic ability, I could perhaps better show you what I mean, but sadly I do not.

With an additional branding message putting it into context, it would help to reduce that feeling, but using it as a logo would be rather creepy.

This one would definitely need some work. Maybe a shield-shaped eye or something, but the rounded eye on its own isn’t going to win hearts.</p>     ",

Although it’s very nice looking, having an eyeball on the logo often is associated with spying or tracking of some sort. If you have that in the logo, being associated with tracking is too negative and goes against the mission that Mozilla is trying to support.</p>     ",

I hear you guys about the Sauron connotation, but since the eye is part of a mark reading “Mozilla,” I think it works. I do think the “dino” connotation gets lost in some of the extensions, however. I wouldn’t be so quick to make it all about the eye.</p> <p>I agree that the yellow and black feels a little harsh–kind of “Stanley Tools.” How about a nice lizard green?</p>     ",
