The downside is that ‘good’ is so general that it’s hard to really pinpoint a specific area of “goodness” to go with. I think after reading the For Good and Change Makers themes it gave a sort of.. hope, I guess? Wanting to back Mozilla in the hope that the internet will be better with Mozilla on our side. Those themes also gave a “humanity first” type vibe (sort of like with Canonical’s Ubuntu).</p> <p>The Guide and For All didn’t really do much for me either way. They were okay, but they didn’t particularly “grab” me.</p> <p>The Fight, For Freedom, and to a lesser extent The Protector actually gave off some slight dystopian vibes. It’s quite difficult to convey freedom and protection on those themes without Orwellian/prison state imagery, and I definitely don’t associate those with Mozilla. This also ties into the Change Makers/For Good themes, as they seem to push the concept of everyone working together to fight/protect/free the internet, rather than one entity who we should trust to do all the work for us.</p>     ","event_type":"Mozilla Blog","source":"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/creative-strategy-on-view/"},{"name":"Tim Murray (@Timotay)","date":"2016-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","content":"       <p>That’s really thoughtful and well considered feedback, Shawn. We feel not just hopeful but confident about the future of the Internet, and victories like Net Neutrality prove that people will rally to keep this human-made wonder free from domination by a few. Couldn’t agree more about representations of Freedom almost require a visualization of its absence. (Think of how much screen time in Apple’s 1984 ad were devoted to domination before freedom got its final few seconds.) Mozilla can’t make people more free on its, but it can help them realize their power and reach through an ever-expanding future Net. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Not that I believe the organization should have showed it’s point of view, I just believe it’s goals shouldn’t be related to the Internet exclusively as described above.

Our global research confirms that a large pool of people make choices in their offline life (like voting, volunteering, recycling, caring for the environment, etc.) that promote the good of their society.

Once this group learns that Mozilla puts people ahead of profit and puts its resources to work improving the health, accessibility, and knowledge of the Internet, they will gravitate in this direction. </p> <p>Our refreshed brand will not appeal to everyone, and that’s OK.

We want an Internet where everyone has an equal chance to succeed. That’s victory for us and for all. </p> <p>As long as Firefox continues to improve its performance, stability, and independence-minded features, people may use it strictly for its utility.
