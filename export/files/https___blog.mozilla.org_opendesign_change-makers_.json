I’d favor a goal over the way to get there.<br> On top, there are 2-3 political parties here in Germany that have their foundations in “change” or “not status quo”. All of them struggle, to various degrees, to not be taken over by extremist minorities.<br> IMHO, putting “change” as a value in to an organization makes that organization weak and volatile.</p> <p>That said, as a secondary attribute to a strong brand, change is a good thing. But I doubt that’s what we’re after right now?</p>     ",

Let’s make good things happen together.</p> <p>You also need to be cautious about selecting political figures and organizations—in particular, recent ones—as representations of a brand identity. I saw various combinations of people and groups above who would not be positive symbols for a number of people I know.</p> <p>What I’m noticing is that most of these themes have bits and pieces I like but in general I’m not a huge fan of any of them. It’s interesting.</p> <p>Also, while “Doers, not dreamers” sounds good, all I can think is “you say ‘doers, not dreamers'” but surround this phrase with imagery and statements all about dreaming of change. That seems funny to me.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>You have a good point here as well, Eric. Especially as a global brand, we need to be cognizant of using political figures as a shortcut to values. Rest assured that these are there to provoke exactly this sort of conversation and are not likely to be a part of our brand identity. (That said, Apple did a pretty solid job of using figures like Ghandi, Mohammad Ali, JFK, and Dr. King in the advertising campaign called “Think Different” surrounding their brand launch – so never say never.) I love the sentiment of “Let’s make good things happen together.” That’s something we have proven we can do time and again.</p>     ",

Honestly, ghe other themes smack of traditional patriotism, like the themes were pulled from the Pledge of Allegiance or some other nationalistic oath. Perhaps even “patriarchal”. Growth, change, the new, the future – these are the modern concerns of the progressive global citizen.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>Thanks, M.A. Yes, it’s interesting how concepts like “Freedom” are so woven into historical ideas patriotism, and have been appropriated by particular political parties and groups, that it can be hard to apply them to a new context like the Internet. Were we to move forward with Freedom as a direction, for instance, our visual language would have to steer clear of any suggestion that we’re representing a single point of view. Setting our sites on the future growth of the Internet as a means of expression and independence for all would be a way to embrace the concept of freedom without the baggage that many now associate with that word. Thanks for adding to this conversation.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>This collage resonates with me.<br> When looking at Mozilla’s recent engagement like Let’s Encrypt, Mozilla Thimble, Mozilla Codemoji I see examples where Mozilla wants to change the way things are thought of today (and educate the masses).</p> <p>Mozilla is not to shy to speak up. For example, displaying a promotion to savetheinternet.eu (which is highly needed since net neutrality is at stake in Europe). Another example in the U.S. would be comments on FCC.<br> Other parts of the world (South America, Asia, Africa) are covered by the community (why?). </p> <p>“Too much privilege for the few” is a topic Mozilla should deal with internally first before rebranding. Mitchell is inviting thoughts on her blog.<br> My last bad experience were with the renaming of Mozilla Community Design (on GitHub) to Open Design – out of a sudden. Elio could tell me that they got consent on MozLondon. But from the point of view of a contributor it wasn’t clear that the name would change. We have to work on that. An announcement being the absolute minimum.</p> <p>I consider Open Design as a step in the right direction for gathering the ideas of many.</p>     ",
