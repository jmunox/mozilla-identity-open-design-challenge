Thanks for continuing to push the thinking about this.</p>      ","event_type":"GitHub open issue","source":"https://github.com/mozilla/OpenDesign/issues/39"},{"name":"Tim Murray (@Timotay)","date":"2016-04-05T13:29:24.000Z","content":"          <p><a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=3149580\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/sarupbanskota\">@sarupbanskota</a> your analogy of Mozilla being like the ocean ecosystem hits a chord. The creative team has played around with the idea of comparing open systems with closed ones as a reference point for the Internet we believe in and the one that big companies are building in an effort to carve up their own markets. Here's an example:<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18054698/14283261/78509b26-faf7-11e5-97d8-c0397a7f6c9f.png\"><img width=\"663\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-04 at 9 44 10 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18054698/14283261/78509b26-faf7-11e5-97d8-c0397a7f6c9f.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a><br>If you agree that the Internet is the ecosystem, what role do you see Mozilla playing? Do we take action and provoke a reaction like Greenpeace? Or are we here to educate and advocate, leaving the action to others? Thinking more about this may result in a symbol that speaks more to what we do in the world versus the system we are trying to change. Really great thinking here.</p>      ","event_type":"GitHub open issue","source":"https://github.com/mozilla/OpenDesign/issues/39"},{"name":"seeam","date":"2016-04-05T13:58:52.000Z","content":"          <p><a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=18054698\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/Timotay\">@Timotay</a> thanks for the appreciation. As I have already mentioned that I'm not much of illustrator or logo designer. Normally I deal with pproducts (interface and little bit of research). So I have created this from that point of view. If you ask me to name some of the best symbolic logo, I will put Nike on the top of that list and I believe many designer/non-designer will do the same.<br>But swhoosh doesn't represent any sign of shoes or without knowing the company you can't tell that it's a logo of shoe company. Rather the swhoosh reflects the values of nike.<br>So I was thinking that way. Without Directly representing an organization fighting for the free and open Internet, I was searching for it's value(s). But couldn't iterate much on my idea, due to my final exams.</p>      ","event_type":"GitHub open issue","source":"https://github.com/mozilla/OpenDesign/issues/39"},{"name":"AndrÃ© Jaenisch (@Ryuno-Ki)","date":"2016-04-05T20:41:54.000Z","content":"          <p><a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=5436686\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/elioqoshi\">@elioqoshi</a> Water can be emulated on the Web using SVG filters.
