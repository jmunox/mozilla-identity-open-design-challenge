    "content": "    <p>On our open logo design journey together, we’ve arrived at an inflection point. Today our effort—equal parts open crit, performance art piece, and sociology experiment—takes its logical next step, moving from words to visuals. A roomful of reviewers lean forward in their chairs, ready to weigh in on what we’ve done so far. Or so we hope.</p><p>We’re ready. The work with our agency partner, johnson banks, has great breadth and substantial depth for first-round concepts (possibly owing to our rocket-fast timeline). Our initial response to the work has, we hope, helped make it stronger and more nuanced. We’ve jumped off this cliff together, holding hands and bracing for the splash.</p><p>Each of the seven concepts we’re sharing today leads with and emphasizes a particular facet of the Mozilla story. From paying homage to our paleotechnic origins to rendering us as part of an ever-expanding digital ecosystem, from highlighting our global community ethos to giving us a lift from the quotidian elevator open button, the concepts express ideas about Mozilla in clever and unexpected ways.</p><p>There are no duds in the mix. The hard part will be deciding among them, and this is a good problem to have.</p><p>We have our opinions about these paths forward, our early favorites among the field. But for now we’re going to sit quietly and listen to what the voices from the concentric rings of our community—Mozillians, Mozilla fans, designers, technologists, and beyond—have to say in response about them.</p><h2><b>Tag, you’re it. </b></h2><p>Here’s what we’d like you to do, if you’re up for it. Have a look at the seven options and tell us what you think. <strong>To make comments about an individual direction and to see its full system, click on its image below.</strong></p><p>Which of these initial visual expressions best captures what Mozilla means to you? Which will best help us tell our story to a youthful, values-driven audience? Which brings to life the Mozilla personality: Gutsy, Independent, Buoyant, For Good?</p><p>If you want to drill down a level, also consider which design idea:</p><ul><li>Would resonate best around the world?</li><li>Has the potential to show off modern digital technology?</li><li>Is most scalable to a variety of Mozilla products, programs, and messages?</li><li>Would stand the test of time (well…let’s say 5-10 years)?</li><li>Would make people take notice and rethink Mozilla?</li></ul><p>This is how we’ve been evaluating each concept internally over the past week or so. It’s the framework we’ll use as we share the work for qualitative and quantitative feedback from our key audiences.</p><p>How you deliver your feedback is up to you: writing comments on the blog, uploading a sketch or a mark-up, shooting a carpool karaoke video….bring it on. We’ll be taking feedback on this phase of work for roughly the next two weeks.</p><p>If you’re new to this blog, a few reminders about what we’re <i>not</i> doing. We are not crowdsourcing the final design, nor will there be voting. We are not asking designers to work on spec. We welcome all feedback but make no promise to act on it all (even if such a thing were possible).</p><p>From here, we’ll reduce these seven concepts to three, which we’ll refine further based partially on feedback from people like you, partially on what our design instincts tell us, and very much on what we need our brand identity to communicate to the world. These three concepts will go through a round of consumer testing and live critique in mid-September, and we’ll share the results here. We’re on track to have a final direction by the end of September.</p><p>We trust that openness will prevail over secrecy and that we’ll all learn something in the end. Thanks for tagging along.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/design-route-a-the-eye/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-147 size-full\"

The ‘Dinosaur Eye’ is the only design that builds upon the already 18+ years long established Mozilla brand. But its genious lies in the fact that it brings the focus to what Mozilla does not and will never do: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Yahoo and Apple all have to avoid associations of the ‘eye’ at all costs, because the collection and sale of user data are part of their business plan. This is also why they will shy away from Logos that make them appear too big and powerfull. But people use Firefox because you care about stuff like mass surveillance, after all “Mozilla is the proud non-profit champion of the Internet, helping to keep it healthy, open and accessible to all.” In a list with all those cutesy and harmless logos of the internet behemoths it will serve as a reminder what the others won’t tell you.

I realize the wireframe and flikflak are trying to do that, but building 3d shapes does not intuitively translate to protecting the open web and making it accessible and empowering to users.  I don’t know what image or icon could encompass all of that, but I do know we haven’t solved it yet.  I think a Foxkeh face would probably be more successful, in my mind, than any of the above examples, with the caveat that it would tie Mozilla even further with the fox imagery.

Which at least the Eye of Sauron image (as others have compared it) doesn’t. And the Moz://a while does appeal to the geek in me, won’t help make others feel we’re necessarily good for them (nor is it easy for all to read) — And I dislike the M:// shorthand there.</p> <p>Personally I think what would help me is a few more, drastically different Proof Of Concepts in terms of logo art, potentially even from a different outsourced firm or two (if these are all the same firm) to get alternative proposals on the table, so that I and the greater community at large, can help inform what *is* our logo in a meaningful way. I’m not sure if this is an option though.</p> <p>Maybe some greater prose on *why* you and others felt these logo proposals were standout, how they came to be, etc would be useful to me as well. What do you feel they represent, were there alternative designs of these things in earlier stages where they could have made sense taken a slightly different way? Things like the “artsy vertical Mozilla” how do you see it portrayed on banners/products/websites/advertisements? </p> <p>A brand re-image is a hard thing to get right, comes with a great deal of scrutiny and stop-energy and a wrong re-image can hurt the brand long term. I don’t envy your job here, but I do hope we can come up with something I can feel proud in displaying as “Mozilla” without feeling dread that I’d have to explain it repeatedly, in a greater detail/pain than I already do with the Dino/plain-text-Mozilla.</p>     ",

Speaking to the Foxkeh face in particular (which, for those not in the know, is a Japanese mascot character created by the Mozilla Japan community around 2007), you’re right to recognize that conflating Mozilla with Firefox may not be the right path for either brand. We need a set of creative assets that can be deployed to represent Mozilla distinct from Firefox. Our exercise here is to lean into different facets of the whole Mozilla (openness, technology, participation/community, our heritage, etc). We’ll continue to refine from these first-round ideas. If you haven’t already done so, I encourage you to read earlier posts on how we identified and refined the narrative territories that underlie the designs. Thanks again!</p>     ",

I can’t really take it seriously. </p> <p>I love Flik-Flag as a logo, despite it’s unwieldy size. It’s playful and it’s geometric patterns definitely make the coolest merch.

    "content": "       <p>I will give a review to each one in the order above.</p> <p>I quite like The Eye, some might find it like it is always watching, I´d try to make it clear that Mozilla is trying to care for you and if you go into private mode looks away or closes in a quick animation. The typo is also quite bold and could make it stand out with the strong yellow. The whole concept around the use/ application should be rethought a bit for clarity. It looks the most stable for sure and could easily be branded worldwide and be recognizable.</p> <p>Tribal is an interesting idea, with the whole aspect of community, it kind of reminds me of Vaio  though. I love the use of the name in a creative way and the reuse of the same elements, though they should always stay the same, don’t use new or modified letters, use the ones you have. Recognizing and global reach will be a hard one with this one, it’s not instant, it’s a slow approach logo (what I mean by that is that you have to get used to it over a long time to really recognize and appreciate the connections).</p> <p>Please don’t use the elevator one at all, it’s kind of terrible, colors, shapes and meaning seem to far off to be any good. I don’t see any value in this one.</p> <p>The most technical yet is Moz://a, love it for its clever use of characters and meaning, it’s hard to see this one outside of community driven aspects that have a deep connection to the brand. It also may seem like a silicon valley pun like Tumblr or Flickr. Hard to market to a bigger audience because of those limitations and quite boring appearance.</p> <p>Wireframe looks interesting, is too common for it to be special, just look at Watch Dogs or any other tech company that wants to be edgy. Everyone seems to love the wireframe, most forget that it is so common that it is interchangeable with anything else. Interesting animations could be possible, the limitations of not being recognizable kill the concept for me.</p> <p>Impossible M is a retro modern approach alla MTV with the changing logo fillings, it feels retro but also new because it hasn’t been done for a while, instead of giving it a plain filling this one lets the brand explore more of the day to day basis (Google Doodle). Memorable for sure if there is interesting content provided inside the logo and if it tells a story or conveys an emotion, if not it will fail quickly and become another 3D like letter (Medium). Keep the edginess and embrace it, separate the Logo from the name and make them stand for themselves, the strong point is the interchangeable voice the logo can speak, use it to your advantage and show that you are always on the pulse of time.</p> <p>Flik Flak looks promising, in animation or not, but there is just to much going on for my taste, maybe try to make it simpler and always convey it with movement to show the deepness of the ideas that are put with it. Colors should also be rethought and be chosen to fit together better and in a more defining way, maybe a 2 color variant, with black and violet, which would stand out for sure and make it one of the few with that color that could embrace it. Violet would be a goof fit for several reasons amongst them being different and conveying a sense of thrust that goes along with it.</p> <p>Those are my quick opinions on those concepts, hope I could help out.</p> <p>Sebastiano Develli</p>     ",

I don’t think so. The design might fit some brands but definetly not Mozilla.  The connector one is by far the most interesting, but there’s just too much going on for a logo, it would look awesome with a ton of simplification. “Open button” more like generic logo, if it didn’t say Mozilla I would’ve never thought. The protocol one is great, but not what I would call “appropriate”. It’s too “simple”, when comparing to the simple old mozilla text, it’s like putting the IE logo side by side with Edge logo. Moreover it looks like :/ The wireframe one is decent, but just like the first one, not really what fits the brand the best (IMHO), but it’s closer to home. If it is chosen I won’t go screaming “Mozilla isn’t what it used to be”. After that we have windows 98. And the last one looks like a cutout, I don’t even get it.</p>     ",

I don’t feel that way about any of these options.</p> <p>If I had to choose, I would pick either Moz://a or the Eye.   However, I spend a lot of time working with teens and I can promise you they will see something other than an eye, especially if you use the “All Hands” guy.  If you are going to go with that option, you need to change the pupil.  For the Eye I also feel the lettering is too thick and overpowering.   </p> <p>The exact opposite problem is happening with Moz://a.  There isn’t enough style to the letters.  I don’t think it needs heaps more, but it is a bit plain at the moment.  It should feel like someone designed it, right now it looks like someone just picked the first typeface they saw.</p> <p>These are my two top choices because they are fairly simple and with a few tweaks could be instantly recognisable.   Looking at these logos I tried to think of which ones would look good on a button or sticker.  The others are too complex, too much, and too old-fashioned.  If I knew nothing about Mozilla and saw those logos I would be incredibly confused.  Actually, I do know quite a lot about Mozilla and I’m still confused looking at them.

However, seems that most of the people here favours the M:// one. That could work too, but that identity does not offer much flexibility into the different projects of Mozilla, and I don’t consider the pictograms as a big part of the identity. They typography of M:// is flawed since it’s using Helvetica heavy – not only a proprietary typeface and not open at all, but also would make the wordmark look too generic, just like some everyday brands you see at the supermarket. Therefore an open and more characteristic typeface, or a set of lettering specifically designed would give that identity a big boost.</p>     ",

I don’t want to detract from such early concepts, but none of the concepts feel imbued with the Mozilla’s humanity or attitude. Thus far, I’m left furtively hoping that we’ll excavate The Dino.</p> <p>Impossible M is gorgeous, but lacks character. It mostly reminds me of the exhibit advertisements I see on the side of my local modern art museum. The animated treatment seems to take more than a little inspiration from MTV’s early identity.</p> <p>The developer in me loves Protocol, but I also wonder if it hews a bit too closely to Slashdot and cURL’s logos, or if it might be mistaken for Moz, the SEO company. It’s also interesting that Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Opera all hide the ‘://’ protocol delimiter in their address bars. Tying our identity to a disappearing symbol might not be the best long-term bet.</p> <p>I love how Wireframe World’s perspective can flip depending on which faces are shaded, but… where’s the humanity? Or the Mozilla? Substitute “MoMA” for “Mozilla” and you’d still have a believable mark.</p> <p>The Connector is lovely in a 90’s kind of way, but it’s also an illegible wordmark. The tiled pattern is even worse on that account. And while the MozFest, All Hands, MDN, and Maker Party logos look quite nice alongside each other, they’ll never be presented so close together in practice. Without that proximity for immediate comparison, I don’t think I’d recognize them as part of the same brand.</p> <p>Nothing about The Open Button speaks “Open” or “Web” or “Mozilla” to me. I get a very “bloomberg.com” vibe from the typeface and colors.</p> <p>Flik Flak is super fantastic, but it still falls “flat” for me, again like something I’d see on the side of my local modern art museum. It’s just too… thin and constructed. How would it have a voice? Where’s the warmth and emotional attachment? Would a shape that complex even be recognizable from afar, or in black and white?</p> <p>The Eye immediately reminds me of caution tape, construction sites (Caterpillar!), and the evil Eye of Sauron.  Oddly enough, I also can’t find a past depiction of our Dino with reptilian pupils. Go figure.</p> <p>Good luck! I’m eagerly following along,<br> -Dan</p> <p>PS: Seriously, everything about the eyeballs freaks me out. The proposed MDN logo could double as a Lovecraftian horror. Nobody wants to open a pitch black book and find an unblinking, eldritch eye staring directly into their soul. Or go to a (Maker) Party filled with nine other scrutinizing eyes. Eep.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>Oof. I like where ya’lls thematic thinking is going, but none of these seem very strong.</p> <p>My initial reaction is that there’s only one really viable concept here: The Open Button. The fact that only one option seems viable to me is worrisome. But let’s take it from the top.</p> <p>The Eye: I actually like this one in the way it harkens back to the dinosaur. As a long-time contributor, it feels like it harkens back to our history but in a new, modern way. Nostalgia is a trap. This is a bad justification for a logo. We need a logo for the world, not insiders. Besides this, it feels very aggressively scary, authoritarian, and inhuman. The ‘All Hand’s variant looks like a cop telling me to stop. The Maker Party variant reminds me of insect eyes, or a hive of some kind. Generally, this makes me think my every move will be surveilled.</p> <p>The Connector: Very post modern. It looks random, and it took me a few minutes to see it’s kind of a wordmark sorta thing. It reminds me of the MIT Media Lab logo which I’m also very very much not a fan of. This is better than theirs though because colors and rounded edges. <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_mit_media_lab_by_pentagram.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_mit_media_lab_by_pentagram.php</a> </p> <p>The Open Button: Reminds me of media player UI. Is it a button I can press? Will it play music? Is it like the iPod click wheel? As far as logos go, it’s unique and I think would lead to strong brand recognition. I’m not sure it immediately says/means anything, but the more I look at it the more it’s starting to make sense. It has a lot of potential as an animated logo and maybe even a functional UI thing of some kind. I want this on my hardware, I want it to glow, and I want to touch it. I really &lt;3 where this is going. I don't think it's ready yet and would like to see it developed more.</p> <p>Protocol: Generic, and too developer-centric rather than user-centric. Just like the Eye, this almost conveys the opposite of our mission.</p> <p>Wireframe: Very noisy. I didn't even see the M at first. I'm not sure what this is trying to say. Is Mozilla creating a social network? Are we becoming a data analytics company? There could be something that works here, but some of the lines and dots need differentiation. I'd like to see iteration on this concept.</p> <p>The Impossible M and Flik Flak: Were these from the Alphabet (Google's parent company) reject pile? They look generic, and already dated. The former looks old, and the latter looks like it's going to be old in like 5 minutes.</p> <p>The most viable options here seem to be under the categories of 'Choose Open' and 'With you from the start'. I'd like to see these three options iterated upon.</p> <p>I'd toss the rest and go back to the drawing board with each of their respective themes (which are all great btw!) Each of these themes deserves at least one good option.</p> <p>I'd like to get some feedback from some non-mozillian non-techies. May come back with additional feedback from other peeps I share this with.</p>     ",

One thing though – the typography that sits next to each logo – that’s the bit that really needs the work. Nearly every one uses the same, very dull, and slightly clunky font, (just use Helvetica if you must, at least it’s nicely proportioned) which doesn’t sit well with any if the logo designs.

I don’t know if that would change reactions much, but it almost always helps to read those narratives and to see the various explorations and applications. I see the sentence in parentheses where you’ve invited/instructed people to do so, but you might want to make that more obvious and explicit. I’d make it mandatory!</p> <p>Also, I’m curious why a single narrative wasn’t agreed before beginning the design exploration? I understand that Mozilla (like all organizations) is multi-faceted. But it feels like Mozilla has yet to decide what role they want to play in the world, or at least which of the 5 they want to major in. Perhaps the design exploration is a way to help make this strategic direction more clear? I have to imagine that some of the confusion and dissatisfaction in the comments is from a lack of clarity and agreement on the strategic narrative.</p> <p>To answer the specific questions in your post:</p> <p>Which of these initial visual expressions best captures what Mozilla means to you? – Conceptually: The Connector and Wireframe World. I think they both get at the idea of openness, but specifically through the lens of being open to a COMMUNITY that has the power and ability to shape and reshape the web and make it what they want. Of the two, I think Connector is more unique and original (visually). I feel like Wireframe World has been done before. But with Connector, I have the same concern others have expressed: it might be a little much. I wonder if you can explore a less “tribal” expression that perhaps borrows symbols from programming code instead of circuitry for a softer look and a more recognizable/resonant visual language? </p> <p>Which will best help us tell our story to a youthful, values-driven audience? – It depends on what value you think is most important to this youthful audience. Personally, I think the idea of something that is “powered by the people” or community-driven really taps into the whole spirit of the sharing economy, collaborative consumption, etc. Pardon the buzzwords. And therefore, I think The Connector tells this story best. The younger the generation, the less concerned they seem to be about privacy issues. I think they care about two things: 1) social good, and 2) being empowered to make. Of the two, caring about social good feels like a higher-order value.</p> <p>Which brings to life the Mozilla personality: Gutsy, Independent, Buoyant, For Good?</p> <p>Gusty: The Eye, Wireframe World, The Impossible M<br> Independent: The Connector, Open Button, Wireframe World, The Impossible M, Flik Flak<br> Buoyant: The Connector, The Impossible M (I believe The Eye has potential to be more cheerful and optimistic without going all purple and Barney on us)<br> For Good: The Connector, The Eye (again, with some tweaks to feel slightly less aggressive/big brother-y/less Georgia O’Keefe-y ;-)</p> <p>Overall, I feel The Connector speaks to all but Gutsy. The Impossible M speaks to all but For Good. The Eye has potential to speak to all but Independent. </p> <p>Which design idea would resonate best around the world? – It depends on the primary audience. If it’s the masses, then The Connector. If it’s a pure developer community, then Protocol. FWIW, I think Protocol is brilliant and clever, but a bit boring tbh. That said, Connector doesn’t exactly feel safe and secure. It has so much frenetic energy. I somehow want to infuse Connector with a bit of the calm and order in Protocol.</p> <p>Which design idea has the potential to show off modern digital technology? – The Connector, Wireframe World, and Flik Flak. But what do you mean by ‘modern digital technology’ and how does that apply to Mozilla? When I think of modern and digital I think of flexibility and agility, and I think of systems. Connector, Wireframe World, and Flik Flak communicate those to me.</p> <p>Which design idea is most scalable to a variety of Mozilla products, programs, and messages? – Originally, I was going to say the same three as above: Connector, WW, and FF. Because they’re such flexible and dynamic identities, you can create infinite sub-brands and icons for all the current and future products, programs, and messages. But, one of the problems with these identities is that while they are incredible flexible, they don’t necessarily create memorable sub-brands and icons. Everything ends up sort of looking the same. The Eye, however, does a great job at creating sub-brands and icons because its simplicity and more limited nature forces a bit more creativity and personality. I love the executions for All Hands, Maker Party, Speaking Out, and Privacy. They’re fun, clever, clear, and memorable. Much more so than some of the more flexible—and arguably scalable—identities. </p> <p>Which design idea would stand the test of time (well…let’s say 5-10 years)? 5 years? All of them should be okay for the next 5. Although, The Impossible M and Wireframe World feel a bit too trendy—especially the former. 10 years? None. But that’s probably a good thing, no? Maybe Protocol. But it really feels too proud of its past. It feels just a bit too insular to allow for 10 years of growth and innovation.</p> <p>Which design idea would make people take notice and rethink Mozilla? – The Eye, The Connector, Protocol, Wireframe World.</p> <p>Overall, I like the concept behind The Connector but think it needs to be more simple and refined. My close second would be The Eye if you can solve for its various problems.</p> <p>Sorry for posting the longest comment ever. Obnoxious.</p>     ",

I recommend that in each step, revise and revisit the guidelines, objectives and strategies you people want to print in the brand to make sure it is alligned and giving answers and supporting all that spirit Mozilla represents.

So much fun to watch and engage in.<br> “Good Fight” – I REALLY wanted to like this one because it continues the dinosaur theme.  Originally I was thinking this could work with a color change but no matter how hard I try, I can’t get past the Eye of Sauron and Monsters, Inc connection.  The “looking out for you” aspect just doesn’t come across.<br> “Connector” – Like the colors much better, but really find all the iterations of it too busy across products and projects and really didn’t see the “Mozilla” written out til someone mentioned in the comments.  Like the ability to localize w/ the flags though.<br> “Open Button” – definitely my favorite of all of them.  Agree that it needs different colors though, reminds me of flickr.  I like the “open” button aspect, the “for the people” version, localization w/ flags, the iterations for different convenings, etc<br> “Protocol” – Like the look, like the iterations, would like to see more localization ideas.  LIke the icons you have going w/ it to demonstrate privacy, fight… leads to more customizability for different events, projects, etc.  I like how if folks don’t know it, and see the shortened version it’s an oppty for opening a discussion around “What does that mean?”  It hearkens to open web.  I know I’m harping, but color… please incorporate reds/oranges.  Use/tweak current moz font or similar to maintain continuity of brand?<br> “Wireframe” – Trying to find something I like or something constructive for wireframe, I got nothing.  Sorry.  It doesn’t speak Mozilla to me, it’s too busy for me, I see a jumble of lines not the “M”. Moving on.<br> “Impossible M” – Pretty similar to how I feel abt Wireframe.  It’s visceral on these two.  It looks dated.  Reminds me of an educational programming logo from 1970s… sorry can’t remember the name.  Not digging the switch between angular and curved w/ some of the iterations.  Also, colors.<br> “Flik Flak” – love the colors.  Other than that, I find it busy, hard to see the “Mozilla”, not really grooving on any of the iterations for the different programs or events.  It speaks to me more than Wireframe or Impossible M but that’s about it.</p> <p>Overall… please think about color connection w/ history of Mozilla… reds, oranges, Use blues and add greens for contrast to reds &amp; oranges?<br> Would REALLY like something that brings the dinosaur in to maintain continuity between history and now.  (Dinosaur tail? snout? foot? definitely not the eye, though)</p>     ",

If this is the case it might explain some of the harsh comments about the overall perceived quality of the artworks.</p> <p>As I am a mere engineer with no design education I hope you’ll excuse me if I’ll use the wrong wording. :)</p> <p>Cutting to the chase: If I may be blunt none of these logos resonate with Mozilla in any particular way and they all made me feel “meh”. As somebody else has pointed out I’m puzzled by the choice of not leveraging Mozilla’s historical identity in any obvious way: for some reason the historical “red/white” palette has been ignored in all the drafts.</p> <p>Somebody has also pointed out that these drafts could be applied to any other company; for some of these drafts I do agree with this assestment; most notably “The Wireframe World”, “The Impossible M” and “Choose Open” are the most generic ones.</p> <p>If I were to pick one I’d probably go for Flik Flak because of the resemblance with the beloved Dino. If I can offer a piece of advice: I’d strongly simplify its overall style with smoother lines and less sharp angles to give him an overall feeling of “trustwortiness”. The historical red/white color palette would surely balance that with a bit of our historical sense of “rebellion”. :-)</p> <p>About Dino: we mozillians are very fond of it. I’d be the happiest person on the planet to see it coming back in a fresh look. It means a lot for us mozillians, Mozilla and the web. As we look forward to Mozilla’s next challenges we should also keep tight on our roots and “a new Dino” might be the answer, IMHO.</p> <p>Of course all these are just my 2c. Whatever the outcome, I’m pretty sure it’ll be outstanding!<br> Thanks to Tim and his team for their dedication; I’m sure that replying to all the comments requires a lot of patience. :-)</p>     ",

The EYE proposal reminds me of one of FireFox’s competitor’s logo. I think Opera already took this one… (it’s hard to distinguish the two – apart from color)</p> <p>When I look at the CONNECTOR, it makes me think of a festivity. However, to see the meaning, I had to look and think I am looking at a Mozilla logo. A little too complex.</p> <p>Let’s press the OPEN BUTTON! At first I did not clue into the idea of the elevator door button. I am used to seeing elevator doors open buttons like this:  </p> <p>The PROTOCOL really captured my attention! I think it is really a good idea. However, when abbreviated, it seems like “MILL” (M://) – this is a minor infraction in my opinion. </p> <p>The WIREFRAME WORLD is flexible! It seems like a good way to represent the organization but in a – again very abstract way. </p> <p>The IMPOSSIBLE M is, well, impossible! I would need some getting used to for me. I think it is not bold enough. It doesn’t take up lots of space and so reminds me of a lack of – something (ie: innovation, dedication… clearly not what I see in Mozilla).</p> <p>FLIK FLAK away! It’s a neat design, looks great for animation. I have trouble seeing the MOZILLA hidden in the folds. It doesn’t seem to fit the screen very well. </p> <p>Overall, I am a PROTOCOL supporter! I think it best represents the mission of Mozilla (or should I write Moz://a) and relates to the Web and technology in general shaped by the Web. The idea of the face in text is also cool. The PROTOCOL is standing out the most to me.</p>     ",

It takes a novel approach by distilling Mozilla down to a schematic of sorts, representing to me how the web is comprised of a series of components built on top of one another that together create the content we see and interact with.</p> <p>The way the shapes are created and fold also present an exciting challenge and opportunity for building out the brand.</p> <p>Open Button and The Connector both represent minimalist conceptualizations of what Mozilla, as an open-source, not-for-profit, to me stands for when it comes to building the web: Openness, inclusivity, the human connection. That said, whilst both have great potential in the build out of the brand, I do see their approach as an expected one.</p> <p>To speak of the others I did not select, Protocol, Wireframe World seem too simple, lacking in potential. The Impossible M to me does not represent Mozilla’s mission or purpose (I almost see it as being more suited to a printing company), whereas whilst I understand The Eye returns to Mozilla’s earlier days, I was never personally taken by the Raptor, which I was never able to associate with what Mozilla does.</p>     ",

I’m well aware that blue is the tone used to express trust and security, but I don’t think that it applies to mozilla, as the commitment for security is already well known; I would preferably focus more on expressing the excitement of the browsing experience and so stick with the red/warm tones.</p> <p>For the same reason, please avoid absolutely “the eye”. It definitely look like an evil eye. It’s shouting distrust on every single curve of the logo.</p> <p>“The connector” is interesting, but it looks like a touristic logo. Too much complicated (and too many colors). But I like the font used to write the plain text part of the logo.</p> <p>“Choose Open” is sad. Absolutely sad. It looks like a logo for the remote control of a tv set. Or for a music platform everyone will forget very soon, though the idea of making it the base for an emoticon was very smart.</p> <p>“The protocol” is the one I predict you will choose in the end. It’s moderate and highly expressive of the fact you are a… software house. I don’t like the abbreviation and I think you should never use it in your official documents, in order to respect readability and accessibility purposes, though it was a very cool code.</p> <p>“The wireframe world” is very interesting. Looks very much like the logo of an architect and gives a strong idea of the fact you are a solid and creative foundation, but I think it has the defect of not having the name on a horizontal line. Plus the black color is a bit heavy.</p> <p>“The impossible M” is my other favorite with Protocol. But again I don’t like the colors. And I don’t like the font used to write Mozilla. I would go for something more rounded to express empathy towards the user.</p> <p>“The flick-flack” is very experimental and pleasant. But… it’s totally unreadable.</p> <p>You will never do, but in the end I think you should come back to the creation step and do it again.</p> <p>—</p> <p>Anyway I really think that the old simple text without the dyno was enough. I would have added just a reference to the firefox icon on the “o”. Something like the attached sketched.</p> <p>Thanks for the attention.

I think you should consider to start from scracth and gives more basic directions to the guys who like to participate into this process, because right now, I dont see any potential on any of those logos.</p> <p>My two cents:<br> 1. The eye: Looks like mordor and kill bill togheter.<br> 2. The connector: It looks quite nice in only one layout (whe it is readeable), else than that, is just like a clever puzzle.<br> 3. Open button: This looks extremely generic… in fact, I think this could be more related to microsoft and the xbox 360 than an open source company<br> 4. Protocol: Is something that resemble the born of the intenet and the main idea ( I think) is to renovate not to make a resemblanse to the old glory days… is to move forward and looking to the future, not looking to the past… so please dont.<br> 5. Wireframe: Lazy<br> 6. The impossible M: Again, this is a look to the past not to the future, this logo could be done in a Pc 80386 in the early 90s using Logo programming language ( if you are old enough, you shoul know about this DOS software)<br> 7. Flik Flak: Not cleaver, not visually appealing… maybe looking the animation could be cool, but for an still logo, this doesnt means anything.</p> <p>Conclusion:<br> Pleas start from scratch and make this event more world wide and share this even within Designs universities that have a bunch of studendts full of cool ideas that just want to participate.</p>     ",

I find it too heavy, and, like some other comments, the eye mostly makes me think of 1984 and mass control.</p> <p>Connector : the idea is good but the result is not good. It looks more like a maze than like connectors and it is not readable.</p> <p>Open button : this one is quite good and closer to the target. A simple, graphic and easily recognizable logo design. I think you should try with other colours to be sure it really looks like open / on (perhaps use one darker colour for the circle and a brighter color for the rest, not only the bottom). I’m not fan of the pink colour (but I don’t like pink in general).</p> <p>Protocol : This one is also quite good. I like the principle and :// that really match the web. But I find the colours are too bland especially the Moz://a with two blue. The blue on the girl t-shirt example is better.</p> <p>Wireframe: again a good idea with a bad result that don’t make sense and some declinations are horrible.</p> <p>Impossible M : The third one I think are quite good. But I would remove the colours and effects on the side and only keep the lines. In the declinations, please remove these blinky and outdated colours and gradients, else the pictos for webmakers, privacy … really works and match the logo design.</p> <p>Flik flak : I don’t understand this one. it doesn’t work, is not readable and too confusing.</p> <p>In general, I think you should focus on a less is more principle with a simple graphic logo with a set of simple colours and take care of the font set.<br> Also, in most of the cases, the logo variations per country changes too much the logo. I would avoid it.</p> <p>Hope this will help.<br> Cheers</p>     ",

I’m not sure the icongraphy is going to be easily understood without explanation</p> <p>D: Protocol – My preferred option of those presented. I think the font could do with some work and be softened in come way, or possibly more closely related to common coding fonts. It elevates the logo beyond only type without the need for any icongraphy that often tends to overcomplicate a logo.</p> <p>F: Wireframe &amp; G: Flik Flak – Both of these are just too complex and busy. The Flik Flak logo especially is just too complex and not clear.</p> <p>E: Impossible M – Everything about this looks retro, especially with the neon colours. While these have become prominant again in certain industries it just serves to date the logo even before it’s started and seems to look backwards rather than forwards.</p> <p>With the exception of the Protocol option none of these, in my view, offer anything more than the existing logo and surely there is no point in making a change unless this change brings something better. The Protocol seems like a good starting point but does need further development to warrant replacing the existing logo.</p>     ",

If I had to say something about each of them, it’d probably be this:</p> <p>The Eye: I’m uncertain how the eye connects to anything that Mozilla does, in some of its incarnations if looks dangerously close to Opera’s “O”. As was already pointer out, is the All Seeing Eye a good logo for an Internet-oriented company at times when Internet privacy and security are one of the hottest topics? </p> <p>The Connector: I’ll admit that the logo looks fresh and lively, but the overall arrangement and color choice suggests something I’d expect to find on the doors of a kids toys store.</p> <p>Open Button: The color choice is terrible and the overall feel is sort if “artificial”; it seems to be screaming “Hey, I was designed to be a logo of a company” at me. Also, am I the only one who finds it kind of… suggestive?</p> <p>Protocol: This one is the one I find the most tolerable. On the other hand it looks kind of uninspired and sterile.</p> <p>Wireframe world: I’m uncertain what to say about this one except that it just doesn’t work for me. I’m sorry that I can’t be more constructive about this one.</p> <p>The Impossible M: I consider this to be the worst one. The color palette evokes Pinball Dreams with incorrectly chosen video adapter. It also has the kind of 1980’s feel to it. It’d be cool if you were aiming for retro, but that’s not your goal here, right?</p> <p>Flik Flak: I happen to kind of like this one. At least there is some originality to it. The full “Mozilla” tower is probably too big and complicated, but the simpler “Moz” is pretty fun. Plus it looks a bit like a stood-up cobra:)</p> <p>To put this in a bit of perspective, all of the fictional companies featured in the “Silicon Valley” TV series have much better artwork than anything I can find here and that is something that only needs to be shown for a few seconds on a screen every now and then. I’m sorry to everyone who worked on this but unfortunately that’s how I feel about it…</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>After sitting with these for a little while, I think the 2 concepts that have the most potential are The Connector and The Impossible M. The Connector, because of its expansiveness and flexibility. The Impossible M, because of its strength as a cohesive mark.</p> <p>The Connector feels like it’s the building blocks for a whole visual language, and it gives me the sense of many different pieces working together. That feels like it has some nice parallels with Mozilla’s mission.</p> <p>The Impossible M, visually, feels like it has a ton of unrealized potential that needs to be explored. I could see a lot of different takes on the colors and shapes that make up the M, even potentially breaking those shapes apart in a way that brings the visual style a bit closer to The Connector. For a single indelible mark, The Eye, Protocol, and The Impossible M are the best candidates. The Eye is too creepy for me, and Protocol feels stuck in the past and tied to a bit of internet arcana that –&nbsp;while clever and recognizable to many people –&nbsp;seems limiting.</p> <p>Both The Connector and The Impossible M could benefit from a lot of refinement (which I know is coming). The most glaring execution issues, to me, pertain to the wordmark that goes with each one. The word “Mozilla” needs to not feel stuck-on or like an afterthought, but like an integral component. Some low-hanging fruit as far as bringing the wordmark in line with the logo mark: for The Connector, using a typeface that picks up on the roundedness of the other shapes. For both, using a typeface whose ‘M’ slants outward on the sides – even if not in as extreme a way as the ‘M’ shapes do in both logos – rather than an ‘M’ with straight-up-and-down side strokes.</p> <p>A last word on The Impossible M: I get that part of its ‘backstory’ comes from vibrance, creativity and diversity, which are all great things to connote. But I think it’s a bit hamstrung by its retro vibe. In an age when we no longer need to be so concerned about viability for printing processes (color separations, moiré dot patterns), the dots feel like an unneeded throwback. I would encourage everyone (especially the designers!) to look beyond this specific visual style, and judge the concept based on the underlying shape of the mark.</p> <p>Just my 2 cents. (OK, maybe that was more like 20 cents.)</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>I am in the same camp as Aki and Justin.</p> <p>It is going to be extremely difficult to separate The Eye from the feeling of surveillance.</p> <p>And, several other people here have mentioned that they felt these designs could easily be exported to essentially any company or organization. To be clear, that is almost already the case. Cf. the new curl logo: .</p> <p>I have been a long-time user of Firefox (been using it almost continuously since I first started using the Web really). In recent years, my confidence has been shaken by various choices that Mozilla has made (each of which seemed to be taken because Mozilla had forgotten its purpose). All of the designs above do nothing but underscore that aimlessness that shook my confidence in the first place.</p> <p>If given the choice, I would scratch the rebrand effort wholesale until Mozilla has figured out what direction it should be headed in, and then a rebrand can be used to emphasize the new mission statement.</p> <p>For the sake of completeness, I would like to include what I think Mozilla’s renewed mission should be:</p> <p>1. Freedom (or, perhaps Liberty depending on how rigidly you separate the two concepts)<br> 2. Diversity (or, perhaps Inclusivity or Openness; consisting of people of many different backgrounds means nothing unless everyone is welcome)<br> 3. Community (yes, this is separate from 2. Mozilla has always thrived because of the community that surrounded it; from its contributors and from those who believed in its goal)</p> <p>In thinking about the above goals, the attached images are the thought-process I went through arriving at what I feel could be a decent concept (note: I am rather obviously not a graphic designer; but they’re meant to be concepts, not finished designs).</p> <p>At first, I immediately thought of a Venn Diagram between Liberty and Diversity where the overlapping center would be Mozilla.</p> <p>While simple, I do not believe it adequately captured Openness as a guiding principle. So, I dropped the old Meta-Bold “m” and opened the bottom of the Venn Diagram (leaving an “M” in the overall shape).</p> <p>Progress, but I still think that Community is an important part of Mozilla and should be reflected here. So I wanted to add some bounding to the concept. At first, I thought of parenthesis which could look/feel like arms enveloping the “M”. But, with the Venn being a part of the logo, parentheses seemed to just add line noise. Another large part of what makes Mozilla (or, what I believe should make Mozilla, anyway) is the web. And, in accordance with the RFC for URIs, there are only two things which you should use to surround a URL: whitespace and .  seemed perfect. For the sake of style, I opted for ⟨⟩ rather than  only because Linux Libertine has rather beautiful glyphs for them and they meld in well.</p> <p>I should also mention that, if there were to be a fourth Guiding Principle I think Mozilla should endorse, it would be Revolution, and I do not believe the concept I offer here does anything to evoke the revolutionary spark that I would like to see.</p> <p>While these designs are offered freely and without restriction (consider them Public Domain or CC0), I would prefer Mozilla did not use them without first seriously reevaluating its goals and mission.</p>     ",

You’re losing your branding with that one, and you may have issues with keeping it as ‘your logo’ if someone copies it due it being so generic.</p> <p>The wire frame logo would be decent if you were, say, a 3-D printer company, but as it is, it’s too monotone (the opposite of the tribal issue).</p> <p>The abstract unfolding Mozilla has too many colors, and too many facets.  I like how the Mozilla is hidden in the design, but you’ll also need that logo to work in monochrome, and I don’t think it will.  </p> <p>The impossible M is too simpllistic, and looks like it was done in Microsoft Paint.  It would be ok for a smart phone icon, but not a company logo.  Plus the color scheme screams ‘blah’.</p> <p>Finally that leaves us with the Moz;//a, which is the best of a bad lot.  It’s cute and geeky, but it’s also going to be confusing to people like my mother who’s 75, and actually computer literate (more so than a lot of people younger than her).  If it confuses her, it’s going to absolutely brain stump the average user ‘I use the internet for e-mail and adult entertainment’ crowd.  Which unfortunately, are a lot more as a potential customer base for Mozilla than the geeky nerds are.</p>     ",

Being a designer, I couldn’t help myself but play around with this and came up with a logo. </p> <p>Drawing from the roots of the brand, I went back to the iconic dinosaur head and tried to condense its feeling into a simple, but recognizable shape: to me, the spikes. I felt that the word itself needed a strong, but approachable type so I used a condensed version of Myriad Pro. Finally, the bold RGB red used to color the old dino head seemed like the perfect touch to at once 1) confirm the connection to the brand’s visual legacy, 2) add a pop of color and energy to visually symbolize the trailblazing nature that has always defined Mozilla, and 3) to maintain a connection to the web, by using the classic RGB red.</p> <p>Let me know what you think.<br> Olivier</p> <div class=\"comment-image-box\"> <p class=\"comment-image-reloaded\"><a class=\"cir-image-link image-id-244\" href=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/mozilla-logo.png\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/mozilla-logo-500x410.png\" class=\"attachment-baseline-mini-grid-thumb size-baseline-mini-grid-thumb\" alt=\"mozilla-logo\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 600px, (max-width: 1000px) 160px, 300px\"></a></p> </div>     ",

    "content": "       <p>1. Eye – I like the readable but stylish letter outlines, and the contrasting whitespace. However, the eye first reminded me of the Eye of Sauron. Only after a few moments did I realize that it was referencing the Mozilla red dinosaur. I like the reference in that context, but I think most people will not know the history of the logo, and the logo will make them think of something evil always watching, like I first did. I like the colors, but having multiple eyeballs in sub-logos just looks weird. Free-floating eyeballs are gross.</p> <p>2. Connectors – I found it hard to notice the letters in the square form. It looked at first like a nice-looking but simple “M” on top of some unnecessary random lines. I like the written-out word version more, especially the creative but legible layout of the letters “MoZi”. I find it harder than it should be to interpret the final caret shape as an “A”. I would enjoy the logo more if the “A” at the end were more interesting, by having a big form with interesting interlocking like the first few letters do.</p> <p>3. Open Button – The elevator open button look is fine. I was actually kind of disappointed to notice that the logo could be seen as a face as well, because that makes it look more generic – more like a ripoff of LG’s logo. Anyway, I think the bright blue and magenta colors are too garish. Black with magenta would look nicer, if you want to keep magenta because of its resemblance to a mouth’s skin tone. Or perhaps you can make some other pun on an elevator open door that references the web, e.g. a globe or an ethernet port, rather than looking like a person.</p> <p>4. Protocol – I don’t like the protocol look. Even after knowing that the “://” is supposed to mean “ill”, I have trouble reading the name as Mozilla – I keep on mentally sounding it out as Moz-a. Also, the M:// shorthand doesn’t make sense – it would translate to “Mill”, which has no relevant meaning. I also don’t like that the use of protocol syntax doesn’t make sense here – Mozilla isn’t a protocol or anything like it, it’s an organization. Finally, the alternating colors put confusing emphasis on “oz a”. If you want multiple colors, I would suggest having “Moz a” be the dark blue and “://” be the light blue.</p> <p>5. Wireframe World – My reaction is “meh”. I don’t like that the word “Mozilla” is small in this logo.</p> <p>6. Impossible M –&nbsp;It looks aesthetically pleasing enough, but it doesn’t feel especially relevant to Mozilla. The impossible shape isn’t clear enough to be an interesting visual puzzle – you have to look hard to even see that it’s an impossible 3D shape rather than a stylized 2D “M”. On the details page, I wish more of the proposed sub-logos used the dotted gradient, a critical feature of this logo that makes it look good. The current sub-logos have too many bright, flat colors without enough dark blue or white inside to give a break from the intensity.</p> <p>7. Flik Flak – The first few times I saw it, it looked like an “M” shape on top of a pile of random junk. Now that I see the rest of Mozilla, it doesn’t look much better. The varied colors and the high contrast between the colors and greys make the whole thing look very cluttered. It might look better with either less-contrasty colors, or only two very contrasting colors. However, when I click through to the detail page, I like the look of the smaller and simpler “MOZ” version a lot more. I would prefer having that be the full logo, and not having a really tall “MOZILLA” version.</p>     ",

I love all of them in context of branding only, but by far it lacks a lot in technology aspect or maybe in reflecting Mozilla’s vision and mission. </p> <p>The Eye, the moment I looked at it, it was too imposing. It has really strong presence, but it just doesn’t fit with Mozilla. And I’m sure, a lot of people will have said it looks like LOTR Sauron eye icon, so please stay away from it.</p> <p>The Connector feels like the previous London Olympic logo. At first I just can’t read whatever you are trying to convry through it, it just looks like a person is swimming to me. But after some time  looking at it, I understood it, but it could give people wrong impressions just like I did.</p> <p>Open Button feels normal to me. It could work with less ornaments and thinner lines. But right now the brand just gave me an impressions that you guys are working in medical field.</p> <p>The Protocol is the one has the best concept among all. You might want to try Mozi//a. It has better composition right now it is too disturbing when I looked at it. One thing concern me is that it lacks personality of Mozilla.</p> <p>Wireframe has nice concept. Though I doubt 3D is the best approach for you guys. Maybe you want to try 2D looks and taking wireframe of your homepage of Mozilla and use it as your icon. And change the looks of the wireframe because right now it is too ‘classy’.</p> <p>Impossible M rubs a wrong impression to me. It has retro looks with half-tone patterns. You might want try another looks by deleting all the patterns and change the M with a bit of serif looks such as Garamond or Georgia. But for the future I would say please just stay away from this if you able to.</p> <p>Flik – Flok is really bad to me personally and my eyes are hurting. It looks overly complicated and it is like your first ever concept before designing everything else and you think it could work so decided to put it among the final concept list.</p> <p>Yeah that’s my opinion. Other seasoned designers might be better in giving opinion, but if I have to say something, those above is my opinion. I would love to see more of concepta because right now it is too early too decide. You could get something better in the future but you might not. Bear in mind that the branding will becomes the looks of your company for 5 – 10 years to the future like.you said and I feel like you really should lenghtened time schedule to decide everything.</p> <p>Please forgive me for any misspeling.

My feeling here is that all of these pieces are unrefined conceptually and aesthetically. They seem far from being representative of a professional and largely recognized organization. </p> <p>I believe it has to do with the fact that you are making designers do something that should take time at a “rocket-fast timeline”, forcing them to just crank out the first thing that comes to mind. </p> <p>Also, it is weird to me that on the first round suddenly we are seeing digital renditions of concepts, that might even try to pass off as a finished product, with examples of logo’s on  t shirts and such. I mean the logo’s even already animate. How is that a first round? How is this considered a consideration of a route when it seems all fixed? It seems completely counterproductive for the design firm to have put in so much work for animation and mock ups on so many concepts, when in the end one only gets one brand identity. Like 90% of the stuff here for show is guaranteed to be in the trash bin. That is the wrong allocation of time,. They should have not bothered with all the fancy show off stuff, and focused on the real deep conceptual place at this early stage.</p> <p>I would have thought an open design process would have started with conceptual directions and multiple sketches for each way of thinking. I don’t know who is deciding on how the process is to be open, but whether it’s open or not, the process used here to come up with a brand seems a bit whack.</p>     ",

It’s good to hear from you. </p> <p>When we entered into this open design process, we stated that we didn’t how it would proceed or turn out. To our knowledge, this kind of brand refresh has never been done at this scale before. We’ve learned in this phase of showing initial work that it can be challenging for people to assess. To some, it looks like final design. To others such as yourself, it looks like ideation spread thinly in too many directions.</p> <p>We need to show enough work to prove that a concept will extend across the many facets of Mozilla, but not go too far in refining the design in any one direction. There’s no rule book to follow in finding the right balance.</p> <p>You’re right in pinpointing that our timeline for this work is fast, and that the proof of concept is seven times what it would be for a single direction. We are also doing this in the open, which requires another level of communication not found in a typical brand assignment. It’s a Herculean task and one that johnson banks has taken on with good humor while producing inspiring work.</p> <p>These are initial, first-round concepts. Even though each direction is shown in an extended fashion to prove that it can work across a variety of programs, communities, and products, refinement in the designs are still to come.

While Mozilla makes Firefox, the open-source web browser, it does so much more. Mozilla is a nonprofit that promotes an open, free and accessible internet through technology and networks of people as well as products. From being a leading advocate for net neutrality in legislatures and courts to teaching the web in communities throughout the world, it champions a healthy internet for everyone.

Attempts to be trendy at the cost of readability, yet manages to remain unremarkable.</p> <p>Open Button – A decent idea, but  the current iteration comes across as the kind of thing you would see on the side of a plastics manufacturing plant.</p> <p>Protocol – The best of the bunch at this phase. Not too complicated, and neatly references what the company is about. The font is perhaps  a notch too generic, but it doesn’t need much dolling up to reach a usable state.</p> <p>Wireframe World – An interesting concept, but ruined in it’s current state by an absolute lack of artistic balance. Both versions feel wonky in a very off-putting manner.</p> <p>The Impossible M – This one strongly resembles a VGA graphic from the mid 80’s. Imagery reminiscent of 30 year old technology is not what I would use to represent a modern company.</p> <p>Flik Flak – This one also attempts to be trendy, this time at an extreme cost to readability. The eye does not flow naturally through the lettering, and gets caught in the angles and margins instead. It is an excellent example of how not to use a modern art style in a company logo.</p>     ",

But having looked at the full blog post, it just doesn’t portray the right feel for Mozilla, because it actually can look clumsy, and sometimes lazy, because all there is are a bunch of thick black lines, patterns and yellow.</p> <p>Protocol’s typographic treatment looks bland, predictable, the idea looks like it took a few minutes of doodling and not much thought went into it, especially the rendering, a commenter posted a mono spaced version here and that looks so much cooler. But this fact remains, the colon is forced to be an i, when it is in fact a colon. Let me make an example, what if I tell you this `i` is meant to be a colon? As in, My favorite colori red. Yes, it is the same thing, you may wishfully want it to be different, but a colon is not an i. Your company name is then Moz:lla. I’m using Moz:lla Firefox. And, oh you write code do you, oh so does Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft, everybody writes code, and there is no such thing as the M protocol, stop making shit up.</p> <p>The Connector is a mess, it is fussy, forced, too abstract, and if someone doesn’t know it’s supposed to be “Mozilla”, they can’t read that. The way the sub groups are done looks like a bunch of random lines thrown around.</p> <p>Wireframe world looks like you are a 90s company, and you’ve never had the budget to change your logo since.</p> <p>Impossible M should have been rejected before this stage, it doesn’t do anything and it’s ugly, it’s just an M that has been dicked around too much. If you are a designer and you shop this to a client, I think they might actually be cross with you.</p> <p>The Open Button / smiley. Trying too hard to be fun, funny and losing sight of the larger picture. It’s ugly, complicated, too fussy, difficult to distinguish between them, and no one would care to. </p> <p>FlikFlak, seeing the whole picture of the branding strategy, this feels a little bit like Google (before Alphabet), but it is incomprehensible, too abstract, too fussy and complicated. But this looks the best among all of them. But you should reject this as well for your own sake.</p> <p>No amount of random netizen feedback is going to give you the solid answer you need, because while people can tell you what they like and don’t, no one can generate the full brand vision you really need to proceed.

Something about the power button?<br> – round logos are not the easiest to incorporate in to design</p> <p>Protocol:<br> + simple, and therefore with less of the mistakes of the others<br> – “http://” is being omitted in modern browsers, non techy users won’t get the hint<br> – it confuses regarding the spelling (do I google for “moz://a” now?)<br> – the colors look very cold, I think it does not embrace “community”<br> – the font not very expressive, so the logo does not stand out and is not so recognizable<br> – What I think is a very bad Idea in all designs, is breaking the color scheme for variants of the logo.</p> <p>Wireframe:<br> + I personally like the look<br> + actually with a strong enough aesthetic to pull of the variants<br> – looks like for nerds only<br> – looks very aged<br> – not too recognizable<br> – difficult to incorporate in to designs with that warped perspective</p> <p>Impossible M:<br> + actually has a unique mood to it<br> – a bit cold<br> – gimmicky, but if it’s just the M, not the variants that might be ok.<br> – apart from the gimmick little consistency in the variants, though I would prefer a little less color to make it look less like an Ikea Keith Haring image.</p> <p>Flik Flak:<br> – unreadable<br> – funky colors<br> – not very recognizable<br> – my least favorite</p>     ",

One note: the “M://” execution looks good, but would worry people unfamiliar with brand will read as “Mill”<br> Wireframe – Could grow on me.<br> Flik-Flak – The very basic “MOZ” part works pretty well. The unfolded “Mozilla” does not, IMHO – would be fun on an annual report maybe, but feels very busy for a mark.<br> The Eye – its flaws are well-described in numerous other comments. Having said that, I actually like the ideas &amp; look in many ways, just not for this application. It is kind of cute – reminds me of Monsters, Inc. – I could see the germ of this idea, with some different execution, being a strong candidate.<br> Open Button is not bad, but feels like the submissions one gets on (e.g.) 99 Designs, when designers will just throw some stock work against the wall. While the circular mark is interesting enough and can be adapted in different ways, it could be stuck on to almost any other brand just as easily – nothing unique about it.<br> Connector – Cute, colors fine. Reminds me of the poorly-received London 2012 Olympics logo. Also the clever alternate configs are probably not terribly practical/useful as you’ll end up with more chance of conflicts with existing marks the more permutations you play with).<br> Impossible M – I know there is no accounting for taste, so I’ll just say I find it remarkably unpleasant. I understand some people thinking it would look great on a t-shirt, I could see that. Most other applications? I am less sure. The alternate executions are largely quite weak as well.</p>     ",

The Eye belongs to Pixar. The Connector is a deconstructed subway map. Open Button is a power button.  Protocol is a URL (the most relevant of all of them, but still coat-tailing at best).  The Impossible M comes from Escher. The two whose origins are not obvious to me (Wireframe, Flik Flak) are both too complex and too clever.</p> <p>The most successful brands are the simple ones: McDonald’s Golden Arches, Volkswagon’s badge, Amazon’s smile. A good brand is not a brain teaser. It isn’t showing off how clever you are. It is easy to draw, easy to recognize and easy to defend as a trademark.</p> <p>Even the old Netscape “dawn of N” was too complicated and too generic at the same time.</p> <p>My recommendations:</p> <p>Stop trying to say something with your brand other than “Mozilla”. For that matter, “Mozilla” is already your brand. Just develop that. Maybe, _maybe_, consider shortening it and stylizing the M or the Z, but if you do, be careful not to tread too close to Zillo.</p> <p>Consider the color-blind and the cost of printing color vs monotone. If your brand depends on color it will fail.</p> <p>Avoid references to other things (eye of Sauron, power button, Escher). It risks confusion and makes the trademark harder to defend.</p> <p>Your brand should not require explanation.</p> <p>Your brand should be timeless. “Retro” is not good.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>I’m usually cautious when it comes to giving design feedback w/o any background information, as feedback should always come w/ understanding of the concept. This is especially true for branding. However, since these are being presented as is, here are some of my opinions.</p> <p>1) The eye.<br> As many have pointed out, there are various associations w/ the eye. The way it’s depicted, it’s usually associated with something monstrous. When paired with the font, it becomes a bit more childish. So I see the design is more suited for a children’s publishing company, that creates interactive experiences for kids.</p> <p>2) The connector.<br> This by far seems the most flexible system. The square variation is difficult to read, but that is fixed by the 2nd form that spreads the letter forms out. The ability to create patterns, and changing colors adds to the flexibility. The style doesn’t tie it to any particular era, or industry. The country variations becomes interesting, and can allow the brand to speak to region specific consumers.</p> <p>3) Open button.<br> There is probably a story behind the shapes chosen for the button, but it’s a bit difficult to understand as is. The attempt to create a character’s face out of the motif seems slightly force, but it can be fun. However, the trend of creating specific characters as representations have sort of faded in the past couple of years, and seems to mostly relegates itself to the telecommunication companies. So the design can become dated quickly, and may not be industry aligned.</p> <p>4) Protocol.<br> The :// is conceptually relevant, and easily understood for people who are familiar with the internet, or computer languages. However, the type choice, font weight, and the coloring all scream 90’s big corporate tech company, like Microsoft and IBM. It distances itself from the casual consumer. It can make a suitable logo if “corporate” is the concept. The M:// motif also comes of as authoritarian, as if Mozilla is giving off commands. While the text in black is kerned way too tightly.</p> <p>5) Wireframe.<br> Wireframes have been used a lot in recent years for tech business, especially for social media related ones. Some can be seen as variations of an overall branding language, like Medium’s new branding. So there’s a sense of familiarity. However, “draping” the wireframes with flags seems to be a disconnect with a concept that is not really apparent. Condensed fonts also oscillate between on trend and being dated.</p> <p>6) Impossible M.<br> This is playing heavily on nostalgia by harkening back to the 90’s MTV era, which doesn’t necessarily fit a company that is trying to be a leader in technology. While that trend is making a come back recently, like all fads, it can fade quickly. The brand also doesn’t seem to match the audience it’s trying to appeal to, nor does it really seem to match the identity of Mozilla, unless there’s a major business shift.</p> <p>7) Flik flak.<br> This is very reminiscent of branding for art schools from the 2000’s. It is difficult to understand its connection to mozilla’s brand. It is also a bit difficult to read. Not necessarily on trend, doesn’t seem to be on brand, and not really innovative.</p> <p>In general, majority of the logos seem more on trend than on brand. 2, 3 and 4 seem workable if more refinement is put in.  The connector seems to be the most flexible system. Understanding the brand story for each might make one stand out a lot more than the others.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>I read about a third of all these comments here, but now I’m just going to give my opinion without reading the rest. That’s just too much.</p> <p>First of all: Never change a running system.<br> Is there a particular reason why you see the need for a rebranding?<br> This brings me immediately to the “Protocol”: It kind of resembles the old logo the most, while adding some new touch to it, even with a hint of what mozilla is and was about. Nevertheless it is not a complete start from the beginning. However, as some people already pointed out, it has the sad smiley face :/ in it. If you’d really go for this one, I suggest making it green instead of blue. Blue always represents a cold feeling, while green gives a relaxing vibe to the eye.</p> <p>Now for the rest of the concepts. To be fair I don’t really like any of them that much, they always try to overdo stuff. Look at the logos of the most succesful entities on the IT market right now: Google changed from serif to non serif, to make it even simpler and easier to read. Same for Microsoft, the old stylized logo was exchanged for a new more lean looking one. The Apple logo went from Newton sitting under a tree to a simple one colored Apple and the term “Apple” with no additional styling to it. Other succesful things on the web, like reddit, tumblr or yahoo do the same, they reduce instead of adding to it. They are even written in lowercase, just like the current mozilla logo. And it’s successful that way..</p> <p>“The Eye”. Well, nobody want’s the evil eye or Sauron watching him surf all the naughty websights, am I right? Also it looks like a vagina. A company for pussies? Excuse me, but it came to mind. I see no connection between the rest of the “The Eye” logos to mozilla – in fact I see Ubuntu because of the coffee beans.</p> <p>“The Connector”. The slogan “Mozilla” beneath it is quite perfect. Simple, one colored, mozilla just written big now. Mozilla. The a is perfect in this one. The logo above it is having too much color and seems too wild. I see no connection between the logo and mozilla.</p> <p>“Open Button”. This reminds me of goatse. Please do not pick this. And don’t search for goatse if you don’t know what it is, trust me on that one. Also blue and pink don’t really mix that well. I see no connection between this logo and mozilla. It kind of looks like a power button, not like a logo for a browser maker.</p> <p>“Protocol”. Make it green instead of blue and we can talk. I like the approach of having possibilities with the M://, e.g. M://Firefox Phone or M://Firefox. Maybe mix this one with the Connector one? Especially the a needs to be changed in this one. The connection between mozilla and this one is evident. Have you tried making one with round : and the a round circular o and a (the a which is also to be found in “The Connector”), so that the dots of the : can fit into the a and o? In german there is a saying “Das ist das A und O” (it kind of means, “That it important”). It would be quite fitting.</p> <p>“Wireframe world”. Is the web 3D? I don’t think so and I’ve seen a lot. So why wireframes? Also overdoing stuff for no reason. No connection to be seen with mozilla.</p> <p>“The Impossible M”. Looks like MTV or a construction companies logo. The impossible meh. It’s also not timeless.</p> <p>“Flik Flak”. I like it, but it is way too much. There is a connection to be seen, but it takes quite a lot of time to recognize it.</p> <p>I hope you consider what I said, although I’m a bit late to the party here, I am a proud FF user for a very very long time now and I even call a firefox phone my own.<br> I’m sure you guys will figure it out, but don’t overdo something that hasn’t to be done at all!</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>Let me give you my ratings to these designs in numbers 1 to 10,  as well as my opinion and points for improvement:<br> The Connector (6/10) looks too much like the logo of radio station Galgalatz (see image below), maybe you should make it more hollow or have no curve at the edges or folds, or make any changes to differentiate it, otherwise you would seem to be a copycat. Otherwise, it needs more substance. Maybe a bit of three-dimensionality in certain design elements, and a less confusing frontpage.<br> Protocol (9/10) is simple which is good, however the font choice is pretty bad, the logo needs to have a more modern font.<br> Choose Open (8/10) seems like a good option, however it has a poor color choice. I would recommend refraining from “harsh” colors and combinations of such as they strain the eye, and I would also recommend to make the logo not curvy at the edges of it’s elements, that way it’ll look more modern and pleasing to the eye.<br> Wireframe (5/10) is not memorable at all, since it has no substance. You need to be careful with wireframe logos because it gives off an impression of a generic company, also the circles between the lines seem to be unnecessary.<br> The Impossible M (7/10) needs certain changes that will make it as modern as needed, for example, make the logo more flat and less based on outlines.<br> Flik Flak (6/10) is bad, because it is diagonal, and a logo needs to fit for our displays and writing patterns, the small MZ version is more than enough. Either way, it’s too much like Cartoon Network so it needs colors that aren’t childish.<br> The Eye (5/10) speaks surveillance too much, and just looks ridiculous, it’s a logo that feels too “fat” and “Opera”-esque. It has substance but it proves to be a copycat and invoke the incorrect feelings. Maybe change the colors or make it less “fat”.</p> <div class=\"comment-image-box\"> <p class=\"comment-image-reloaded\"><a class=\"cir-image-link image-id-268\" href=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/1997.jpg\"><img width=\"574\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/1997-574x410.jpg\" class=\"attachment-baseline-mini-grid-thumb size-baseline-mini-grid-thumb\" alt=\"1997\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 600px, (max-width: 1000px) 160px, 300px\"></a></p> </div>     ",

In the declination’s add a simple polygonial shaded gradient effect,<br> remove these blinky dots and colours as these are the exact ones used again elsewhere and resembles a fashion brand or from one of the promotional videos seen on MTV  “neon blue, royal blue and canary yellow” and again not that font</p> <p>Flik flak :  extremely poor implementation not readable and too confusing it would only be useful as a fold out with spaces  animation intro so you can actually see the characters, in a after effects animation,  so not worth trying to fix this design, it would need massively reworked and even then “its been done before”</p> <p>In general, I think you should focus on a less is more principle with a simple graphic logo with a set of simple recognized mozilla colour scheme and maintain the original font, as most of these jump too far from that and no longer become recognized by the brand</p> <p>Also, in most of the cases, the logo variations per country changes too much the logo.

I know that design reviews require courage, and open reviews more so, so lots of respect due for that!</p> <p>Brief thoughts on each:</p> <p>The Eye:<br> – Visually strong.<br> – Hard to read as a result!<br> – Aggressive and tiring; triggers lizard-brain fear/disgust centers (particularly in multiple, as in the Maker Party logo).</p> <p>The Connector:<br> – Reminiscent of the terrible London 2012 Olympics logo.<br> – Color opportunities are interesting, but ultimately lead to a total lack of coherence; this ends up as a plain wordmark with some angled squiggles above, which is nothing.</p> <p>Open Button:<br> – Probably the weakest of the bunch. The colors are honestly painful.<br> – Text shows off the difficulty of kerning and weighting “Mozilla”.<br> – The icon itself is just confusing. Meaningless until the other examples show it to be a face, and then it looks emotionless and sad.</p> <p>Protocol:<br> – This seems to be getting positive opinions from folks, but to me it seems trite and a little amateurish.<br> – You’ll either get it, and raise your eyebrows at the bad pun making it into the logo of such a large organization, or you won’t get it and it just looks like a telco’s bad wordmark from 1994.</p> <p>Wireframe world:<br> – One of the better offerings, IMO.<br> – Visually strong, simple enough to use as a logo when it matters, works vertically and horizontally.<br> – Doesn’t try too hard to evoke very abstract concepts.</p> <p>Impossible M:<br> – I like the concept of the impossible M, like the abstractness.<br> – I hate the mid blue. It evokes unstyled HTML and bad Excel infographics. Mozilla has been around for a while; slightly more muted colors wouldn’t go amiss.<br> – Would like to see this explored more, particularly around width and the use of uprights instead of slants.<br> – Reminds me very much of Monogem’s logo, which I feel is very strong: <a href=\"http://www.monogem.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.monogem.com/</a></p> <p>Flik Flak:<br> – The agency partner ran out of good ideas at 6, didn’t they? I can’t find anything to redeem this at all.<br> – Visually cluttered yet uninteresting, hard to use, hard to scale.<br> – Can you imagine someone drawing this on a napkin from memory?</p>     ",

Great potential for scale-ability. Bold, fun, and friendly. Would love to see more iterations on this one.</p> <p>Open button:<br> Doesn’t look like a button, doesn’t say open. Faces all look unhappy. Not as scale-able as other options. Possibly my dislike of the colour scheme is overwhelming my other feelings :P</p> <p>Protocol:<br> My heart wants this one (with different typography) but I don’t think it speaks to a non-tech audience. Protocol is disappearing from the address bar in the browser, I don’t think many will understand this concept – but it sure does speak to me personally. </p> <p>Wireframe:<br> Would like to see more iterations on this concept. I don’t like the dot and line combo because it fades into  the background (lines are too thin?). I do like the privacy logo and the flags with the solid sides. This seems like a really flexible set of design tools, I’d like to see it refined.</p> <p>Impossible M:<br> The “M” says 80s TV production studio to me, I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before. It looks bold in black and white from a distance. I like many of the project logos. The optical illusion is a neat concept. I’d like to see this iterated on – especially the colour pallet which gives me a bit of a headache.</p> <p>Flik Flak:<br> Too busy, too sharp, not techy, not very welcoming, feels forced, doesn’t scale well.</p>     ",

The eye logo probably stays the most true to the old dino head icon, may be a little too aggressive looking. If was being used in FF it would make a nice SSL cert warning splash page.<br> 2. Doesn’t scale down to a 16×16 tab icon at all, too abstract, color overload etc.<br> 3. Simple, but doesn’t obviously reflect the company from what I can see (is there an ‘M’ in there, or something else?). Maybe looks a little to much like a power on/off button icon.<br> 4. Probably the least polarizing of all of them, good simple neutral look. It’s kinda boring but not likely to result in excessive complaining. The minor geek reference is good.<br> 5. Unique, but again, probably doesn’t scale down very well. If this is used, the wire frame portions facing away from the viewer should be a lighter shade to make it less flat and jumbled.<br> 6. Another ‘generic’ option that isn’t going to cause major problems but also isn’t that interesting. I’d go with the :// icon before this one.<br> 7. Would look really cool unfolding itself in a gif animation but otherwise fails every practicality and versatility test a logo would normally be subjected to.</p> <p>I’d probably just go with the Moz://a option, or otherwise rework the zilla eye into some other forms and pick the one that looks the least like a surveillance company/Eye of Sauron.</p>     ",

The various rationales for each logo presented thus far, show Mozilla lacks a unified vision or understanding of the message that needs to be conveyed. This is reinforced by the number of people commenting on how each logo doesn’t “feel” like Mozilla. That core message, that core brand hasn’t been defined yet.</p> <p>To get on the right track, first examine the Vision for Mozilla and what it you do. You don’t have to do it here, but i would gather a team of people and answer the following questions:<br> ○ What do you want people to think and feel about Mozilla?<br> ○ How do you want people to interact with your company and products?<br> ○ What is Mozilla’s goal?<br> ○ What does Mozilla really do?<br> ○ What is Mozilla to the consumer?<br> ○ What is Mozilla compared to the competition?<br> ○ How should Mozilla make people feel?<br> ○ What aspects of Mozilla matter to your Ideal Customer?<br> ○ Who is the Ideal Customer/User for Mozilla?<br> ○ What aspects of Mozilla do you want to push/emphasis?<br> ○ What is the message?</p> <p>Take what you get from answering those questions and then narrow down that information over and over until you are left with a few words that encapsulate Mozilla. Do NOT try to be funny, clever, witty, smart, arrogant, demure, or lie when answering the above questions and refining them into a few words. Be honest and frank. </p> <p>The one to three words you come up with to describe Mozilla should be at the center of the brand. The brand then needs to be at the center of every decision Mozilla makes. If it doesn’t fit the brand it doesn’t fit Mozilla. </p> <p>From the brand, every logo/identity you then create should be a reflection of that core. The various takes on the core idea may be wildly different in the creative phase, but they should all be speaking to the same brand. </p> <p>Hope that helps.</p>     ",

However, people that know a bit about Mozilla and its fight for privacy can easily dismiss this idea. I think user “Jack” on this page had a neat idea to change the colors. It actually removes the “warning/danger/caution” connotation, and is more relaxing to look at.</p> <p>“The Connector”: kind of cool, but difficult to read. Good for people who like to think outside the box, but could be hard to identify for the average Joe. Although, I particularly like variations created by user Anthony Camp on this page (particularly the left ones with the neurons). Maybe that the key for this one is to not let the logo speak for itself, but to leave the name of Mozilla next to it.</p> <p>“Open button”: looks awfully similar to WampServer’s logo and colors. Hardly evokes anything close to Mozilla for me.</p> <p>“Protocol”: the play with :// is fun, and I think everyone can relate with it (understand the reference to <a href=\"http://\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://</a>), but overall this one looks very close to Facebook’s logo. Maybe change the typo and/or the colors? The blue on blue looks quite outdated for me.</p> <p>“Wireframe world”: don’t know how to say it, but it doesn’t work for me. I don’t like looking at it. Maybe because of the black and white? The difficulty to see the “M”? The too simple structure? Anyway, it doesn’t evoke something good or pleasant, for me.</p> <p>“The Impossible M”: overall, I think all of these logos look quite old and do not inspire “coolness” (something you could expect from a change of logo, and also something Mozilla needs). But this one takes the cake! Was it designed on Windows 3.1? I can imagine that it was deliberately designed to look old, but why? Also, I think it resembles one of the previous logos of another brand (can’t put my finger on it though).</p> <p>“Flik Flak”: very hard to read for me (more than The Connector). Also, it would be more suitable for a parcel distribution company, IKEA or a company specialized in making and selling origami.</p> <p>To me, most of these logos look a bit outdated, to the exception of The Eye, The Connector and Protocol. Was that something Mozilla wanted? If yes, then go for it! I can’t understand why, but I’m no marketing/advertisement expert. If Mozilla wanted something new, I would advise refining the Eye, the Connector and Protocol designs, in terms of fonts and colors (and maybe some other tweaks).</p> <p>Anyway, I think this exercise is a really good idea from Mozilla, a good thing for the brand and for the community! I know that you only submitted these designs for comments, but you should also pay close attention to the designs made by other commentators, some of them are really cool.</p>     ",

Perhaps it resonates more with tech-geeks than with all people though.</p> <p>2nd place in my estimation goes to the Open Button design, which I could see perhaps used as a wordmark with the open button element in place of the ‘o’ in Mozilla for instance. It does feel a bit sterile however, like an insurance company logo – it’s a bit corporate.</p> <p>I agree wholeheartedly with comments I’ve seen that The Eye as a design can have a negative connotation. Perhaps this could be softened somehow without losing the lizard eye effect – for instance I had a more positive response to the eye element used in the context of a monster face in the ‘keep the web wonderful’ t-shirt. Perhaps if this design incorporated more elements of a godzilla/monster face it would better represent the -zilla rather than a panopticon environment / all-seeing eye. The shape of the wordmark in this design is already shaped somewhat like the snout of a beast and perhaps this could be emphasized, teeth or nostrils added et cetera. The more I think about this design, the more I feel that it has the best potential for improvement and the boldest/most iconic colour scheme. </p> <p>I actively dislike the remaining designs. I feel strongly that they’re overly abstracted, cluttered, and complicated. Wireframe World looks like a fantastic landing page for a website, Flik Flak looks awesome on a t-shirt, The Connector would be an on-fleek print on a pair of leggings, and the Impossible M looks music-festival-poster trendy. I’d hate to see any of them with the level of frequency that I see the Mozilla wordmark (this is the most friendly way I could think to word my reaction to these ones).</p> <p>Thanks for the chance to throw feedback at this, and good luck.</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>One very important consideration, which I hope the brand team are taking into account, is that the logo chosen doesn’t just represent Mozilla to the world, it’s also a brand for the community, in the way the Firefox logo isn’t. Which means that if a lot of Mozillians think “boy, that’s ugly” or “our logo is embarrassing”, it may have a significant negative effect on people’s willingness to identify as Mozillians. (And it means people will try their utmost to use alternative or older branding, thereby defeating the point. See what happened when they tried to ‘deprecate’ the dinosaur.) So my key hope for the new logo is not that it scores half a percentage point higher on some consumer acceptability metric, but that our community _like_ it and feel “yes, I’m happy having that represent me and what I do”. So my comments come from that perspective.</p> <p>* Route A: I like the eye, but I wonder if yellow and black is the right colour combo.<br> * Route B: far too clever for its own good.<br> * Route C: I don’t see how this is particularly a Mozilla logo, as opposed to any other company.<br> * Route D: I like this one the best. It’s clever, but still obvious what the word says. It’s got the right mix of geeky and approachable.<br> * Route E: I really didn’t see this as an M until the blurb explained it. Again, not seeing how this logo is particularly Mozilla rather than any other company.<br> * Route F: The idea of using various impossible/Escher designs as different logos is really interesting, but you’ve made it hard for it to be appealing by choosing some truly horrible colours :-| So it’s difficult to judge.<br> * Route G: well maybe, but I’m not convinced.</p> <p>Not sure if the colours are up for discussion – I hope so – but I’d prefer a red/black(/yellow/orange) logo like our previous one. Gives some visual continuity with the dino.</p>     ",

The male T-shirt design shows how it could be softened to be a bit more friendly and fun looking, but as others have said it just looks like Monsters Inc. How would this be scaled down to a favicon? The eyeball on its own is just creepy.</p> <p>The Connector</p> <p>I like the tribal/circuitry direction of this. It’s very versatile and feels fresh. Again, I don’t think this would scale down well to favicon size,  the typeface of the accompanying text is boring and the visual design stretched out into individual letters on the baseball cap design isn’t very readable. I think the logo would actually work better in conjunction with the Meta Bold typeface of our existing wordmark, or the similar Fira Sans (bold) typeface we had made. I’d say overall this is my favourite design direction of the ones presented here.</p> <p>Open Button</p> <p>First, I don’t like the colours. They’re too close to Flickr’s colours. Second, it took me a while to get that this was referencing lift (elevator) doors. My first impressions were of some kind of media controls, which would fit more with an audio/video related business. The animations are cute but don’t really make me think of the Internet. I much prefer the all-white logo on the t-shirt design, that actually looks pretty cool, but I’m not sure people will get it.</p> <p>Protocol</p> <p>This really appeals to my nerdy side and I think it’s quite clever. I think the wordmark works better in one colour for simplicty. I wonder how this will scale down to favicon size, that seems challenging. There’s not much graphical design going on here. My concern is that it might be too nerdy, and that for a lot of people it will just difficult to read.</p> <p>Wireframe World</p> <p>The animation is pretty cool but doesn’t seem very related to the actual logo design. I really dislike the wordmark with this. I think this design direction is a bit clunky and for me more associated with physics (molecules) than the Internet.</p> <p>The Impossible M</p> <p>I don’t like the graphics, the typography, or the colours. It’s very 80s/retro, but not in a good way.</p> <p>Flik Flak</p> <p>I quite like the concept and the visuals of this, it makes me think of building in VR. I’m just not sure it works well as a logo. It takes up too much space and is a bit messy.</p> <p>Overall I’d say The Connector is my favourite as a design direction, but I don’t think we’re there yet.</p> <p>When we get branding right I think we do it really well. I loved the unleashed Fox designs for Firefox OS and I think our Firefox branding is very strong. At the moment I don’t feel like any of these concepts live up to that standard and actually I prefer our existing wordmark to all of these. I’d really like to see some other proposals before picking one of these concepts to refine. I’d be interested to see some proposals from visual designers inside Mozilla who know first hand what it feels like to be part of Mozilla.</p>     ",

Combine the pop art sensibilities (i.e. the moire or comic dots) of the “Impossible M” with the colors (though slightly more subdued – or less “regional feeling”) and design elements of “The Connector”, and then further combine it with the design system of “Wireframe” (though tweaked so it doesn’t look like other peoples stuff) which would then allow you to build all sorts of shapes for whatever needs promoting.</p> <p>The possibilities could be endless.

    "content": "       <p>Hello, as someone who has majored in management and has a particular love for marketing I will provide my own take on this.</p> <p>First of all, before choosing, you have to consider two factors, obviously the aesthetic one, but just as important is the way the new logo will position the Mozilla brand, both by itself and in comparison to it’s major competitors.</p> <p>I will start with the “Good Fight” one. Well, I am not a fan of it from a design perspective, it’s just too “rough”. I think that in a browser market dominated by big corporations, Mozilla should try to project a friendly and approachable image to contrast the image of the big silicon valley mega-billion corp of competitors. </p> <p>This logo does not to this. It’s rough, bold and, so to say, attackive. Additionally, in a market dominated by privacy concerns regarding competitors like Google and Microsoft, I don’t think an eye in the logo sends the right message. Do not underestimate the subconscious effect that particular shapes can have. Eye is just connected in most people’s subconscious to concepts like surveillance, Orwell, tv shows et cetera. Even if you do recognise consciously that Mozilla has no relationship to these things, the subconscious effect is still there somewhere silently affecting your judgement.</p> <p>The Choose open option is also not one I would recommend, as it is simply difficult to get the intended message without having already been introduced to the thought process behind it. In contrast, at least for me it has that “boring and sterile” look that fits with a financial institution, risk management and insurance instead of technological innovation, openness and user friendliness. Case in point, the first thing it brought to my mind when I saw it was the Allianz logo. It’s simply too… bland and unclear.</p> <p>The With you from the start series suffer from the same problem of not transferring it’s message without prior knowledge of the thought process behind it’s design. Most people will just see it as a random, “geeky” logo. This perception is usually accompanied by a sense of complexity and technicality, which is not what you should be after for a mass market product intended for people with different backgrounds and computer use skills like a browser.</p> <p>The Impossible M one is simply, in my mind, devoid of a particular message, it is, so to say, empty. It does not transfer a message of either cunning innovation or user friendliness and familiarity. It looks uninspired and has no clear direction, which is a big red flag.</p> <p>On the other hand I am a big fan of both the Flik Flak and the Internet of People. They both look friendly, exciting and inviting, which I think is what the Mozilla brand should position it self as to make a distinction from it’s competitors. </p> <p>Internet of People brings a sense of inclusiveness and openness, while also creating an image of creativity and excitement. Flik Flak retains the values of being inviting and friendly but seems to also include a message of technology and innovation but succeeds in doing so in a way that seems friendly and not intimidating to the beholder.</p> <p>It’s hard to choose one of those two, as I believe both succeed in the basic principles but bring a different flavor with them. My only comes with Flik Flak is that a 3D multi-dimensional logo might be tiring mentally if looked at too often and beware that it will not transfer well to physical devices or print if for any reason needed.</p> <p>For that, I have to cast my vote with the Connector one, it’s open, fun, friendly exciting and inviting. I think it is the one that will best represent the mozilla brand, and is easily the most distinct and memorable of the propositions. Closing, I would like to say that if you do finally choose the Connector logo, it could use with a bit refinement to be a bit easier to look at, mainly in paler colors and maybe a bit more curves instead of edges, so it becomes more eye and perception friendly. If you are reading this, thank you for your time.</p>     ",

We established at the outset of this brand identity initiative that we could not be crowd-sourcing, voting, or asking for work from designers on spec. We believe that design is an expertise hard won from experience. While many people can provide their reactions to a particular design – and we welcome that feedback here – it’s more challenging for the average person to consider designs from a systemic perspective, for instance, or to know where a particular design might fit into a market of competing brand identities. In our experience, voting on logo design doesn’t yield the best outcome because most of us are averse to change at first, warm to it slowly, and embrace it only after it becomes familiar. These are first-round concepts designed to help us explore where to go next, so constructive comments and ideas are the most helpful at this phase of our work. Thanks again for being a part of this conversation.</p>     ",

Superman is noble, of good character and strong/indestructible and can fly and has a shield<br> “Mozilla” is open, transparent, good full of hope, etc. and has xyz distinctives/visual representation.. What does hero mozilla look like?

I’m curious what you mean when you refer to Mozilla keeping our current logo, which today is a word mark. (The Shepherd Fairey- designed dinosaur was retired in external communications many years ago, and is only used internally and on the Mozilla Developer Network.) In a modern, connected world, is a word mark and a few colors a sufficient enough toolkit to communicate? In addition to helping communicate the totality of Mozilla, that’s why we’re engaged in this work. Thanks again for being a part of this.</p>     ",

A person who knows the current product should recognize the new one.   Having said that, here are more thoughts…</p> <p>Moz://a<br> This is the only one that is good – it actually hints at something that relates to the tool.  This is bad because it isn’t an actual word.  You need to know what it is before you know what it is.</p> <p>The  “Open Button” , if followed by word “Mozilla”<br> If this was a stylized version of a well known computer icon used to open, or “goto” something then it could be good because it could suggest what the software does.  However I don’t recognize the icon, you say it is from an elevator – but it’s a bit of a stretch to say that has anything to do with what you do.  I am guessing the group of icons is supposed to suggest a group of people – if so it needs work – in art class it gets a C- .  If the icon actually hinted at the current similarly shaped logo then it might have a chance to be OK.</p> <p>The rest all look nice, but so what?

Bold and clean.<br> Current problem is the high contrast giving me splotchy dark spots as if I’ve been starting at a bright light. That’s workable though.<br> The icon concepts below are decidedly less good. Do not like at all. If you go with this design, you have to drop the Eyeball as mascot. Using a logotype is great, but that fat font needs to be taken down just a notch as the spacing is killing the readability.</p> <p>The Connector<br> I really like this design and I like the flexibility it offers in adapting it to different uses. Good potential here. Love the country flag treatments. Font is both boring and questionable. The dot over the “i” sits too close and kinda clumps into its base. </p> <p>Open Button<br> I don’t like anything about this. Poor color choices, the emoji’s are both aggressive and difficult to decipher. Font is boring here too. Lowercase “o” has too much negative space compared to other characters.</p> <p>Protocol<br> I get it, I just think it’s dumb. I know these things are images, but wtf is up with the font here? The kerning is insane! They’re literally crunched together. I’ve actually opened this up on multiple browsers just to see if that was the problem, it’s not.</p> <p>Wireframe World<br> Has potential, even though not at the top of the list, I’d like to see it iterated on.</p> <p>The Impossible M<br> It’s okay, middle of the pack for me. Maybe it’s the dot pattern that doesn’t quite work, a gradient treatment within the bars or maybe a muted color underneath the pattern. As for the font, the “O” kills the “M” really makes it seems small and almost makes your eye ignore it entirely.</p> <p>Flik Flak<br> My favorite of the bunch. Good font choice, the graphic can be used in many ways, would make for a great animated logo with collapsing boxes or folding out/upwards like an accordion. Offers so much design space beyond just the logo, it’s something you can really build on.</p> <p>Overall<br> Tier 1 – Flik Flak, The Connector<br> Tier 2 – The Eye, Wireframe World, Impossible M<br> Tier 3 – Protocol<br> Tier Delete – Open Button</p>     ",

    "content": "       <p>All of the options are problematic.<br> The monster/eye one at least winks (pun absolutely not intended) at Mozilla’s tradition, but before being reminded of this by the explanation, the immediate reactions I had was: “Big Brother Is Watching You”.  This is not mitigated by the more childlike monster-figures such as on one of the t-shirt mockups.  Needless to say this is the last thing Mozilla of all organizations should be associated with!<br> The connector concept is much less, well, alarming, but at the same time, like the monster, it doesn’t really convey what it sets out to convey. I look at it and see some non-threatening lines, which mean nothing to me – certainly nothing about connectivity. If you have to explain it, then it’s not working.<br> The open button, likewise, does not convey openness. The two play triangles obscure the design heritage from the ON button being referenced, and beyond that – the fact is, it looks like a scary clown, of all things. I think an emphasis on openness, though, should be the central theme of anything you ultimately choose, if indeed you conclude that a logo should convey anything at all. This element is what separates Mozilla from literally every other major web and mail interface developer on the planet.<br> Lots of people seem to like the protocol theme. While I like the simplicity of it, and just being able to read the word ‘Mozilla’, the central pun is too obvious to the people who Mozilla already appeals to, who already know what it is and what its full suite of products are. They might find it cute, or they might find it dumb; I’m leaning towards the former. At the same time, it might not be obvious at all to those you’re trying to reach out to. The protocol prefix and :// are less ubiquitous today than in the past since today’s browsers – including Firefox – do not display it unless some protocol other than http is used (https or ftp for example), so I’d also find this design choice conceptually inconsistent: if the protocol matters so much, why omit displaying it in the address bar?  That said, it’s hard not to be drawn to the simple “M://” somehow (the :// replacing ‘ill’ in Mozilla on the other hand strikes me as a silly pun). I still think it would not be the correct choice, that conveying openness should be the top priority, but…I dunno. Maybe there’s potential here, too. Protocols of course are open specifications, so maybe this could in some way convey openness…but again, precisely to the people already in the know. The general populace just won’t get it.<br> The last three designs are all entirely too abstract and meaningless. They have no staying power. And they should not be in the running whatsoever.<br> All that said. I’m a bit puzzled. If the mission is to telegraph something about the organization behind Firefox, Thunderbird, Seamonkey (well not exactly that one but still) – well, what does the nonsense word ‘Mozilla’ really do for you, anyway? It only ever made any sense with the Fairey dinosaur. Having to make a logo that both makes the ‘Mozilla’ name distinctive *and* implies something about what that name should stand for when there is nothing inherent to point to that meaning in the word ‘Mozilla’ itself – at least, outside of the tech community – well, that seems to me like a tall order. I’m not saying the name Mozilla should be dropped, necessarily, but that it doesn’t look like you guys were clear-eyed about what the task to be done here is were you to stick with it whilst having goals other than mere distinction, and have bitten off more than you can chew. If you guys *did* realize this, really – well, I don’t think you ever would have approved most of these designs, even in a preliminary manner.<br> Personally, I think that making Mozilla distinct might be a more achievable goal – in this I agree with commenter Robert de Forest’s analysis above – rather than trying to do both that *and* shoehorn meaning into the word ‘Mozilla’. Updating the Fairey dinosaur, *maybe* in a way that pays homage to NCSA Mosaic and Godzilla, should probably be your starting point if you chose to do this. As for making the public more aware of the fact that Mozilla is more than just Firefox: once again this is a tall order for a logo, and there are more obvious places to start. Any information about any product other than Firefox is completely buried at mozilla.org. There is no obvious way to simply get to the download page for Thunderbird, for example – I kept having to Google it.<br> I’m sure that none of this is what you want to hear, and I promise that I’m not trying to be negative for the sake of being negative. I care a lot about this organization, and was one of the original contributors to the NYT ad campaign ahead of the Firefox 1.0 release, and think Mozilla would be very poorly served with _any_ of the options put forward in this blogpost, as they are right now.</p>     ",

In the ‘About Mozilla Open Design’ page you mention “being transparent is what we do”, “inviting others to participate in making a better Internet”, and “work together to prove that the Internet can be a place of empowerment, opportunity, and choice for all”, The Connector identity design relates to the points mentioned.</p> <p>The negative space around the logo itself resembles being transparent as there are no boundaries or a frame. Due to this it’s also inviting and the 90 degree angles in the shapes used give a sense of invitation as they are almost hugging each other. </p> <p>How the identity has been applied to work for or in different countries is also very effective. It adds a personal connection and clearly makes the identity of Mozilla versatile. This connects to ‘working together’.  </p> <p>The identity could also be active, it could have motion where the shapes move about in Tetris form and create the Mozilla logo or the national versions of the identity.<br> As for the colour scheme the logo version is eye catching and is appropriate because of the fact Mozilla likes to work with people. I would however change the black used on the name to one of the colours used in the shapes because the black itself is too strong and doesn’t seem to be a part of the whole design. The national versions work out great as the colour used in text matches the colours used in the shapes. </p> <p>Hopefully my feedback helps in anyway. By the way awesome idea of inviting the public for their feedback on building and developing you brand identity. Great experience. </p> <p>Thanks Arun</p>     ",

These examples are designs of branding 20 years ago – with “explaining” the company’s profession or drawing odd geometric forms.<br> Today, the priority of a logo lies on working on all media (web, print, 2D, 3D, moving) instead of explaining. It has to be legible, recognizable, transparent, working on every background/surface, and even varying its form (just as the flik flak example, although it has nothing identical with it). And, above all, it has to be S-I-M-P-L-E.<br> I don’t know where this crowd-questioning is leading, but developing a new corporate design is a process that needs professional advice. Either the next logo is a summary of all this – then Oh my God. Or the next logo is completely different – then what was this all for?<br> Just to show you what I mean (and this is not a layout, because design needs a briefing!), I attached an example.<br> Cheers<br> Peter</p> <div class=\"comment-image-box\"> <p class=\"comment-image-reloaded\"><a class=\"cir-image-link image-id-344\" href=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/Mozilla-1.jpg\"><img width=\"397\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/Mozilla-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-baseline-mini-grid-thumb size-baseline-mini-grid-thumb\" alt=\"Druck\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/Mozilla-1.jpg 397w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/Mozilla-1-300x271.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 600px, (max-width: 1000px) 160px, 300px\"></a></p> </div>     ",

Also those two colors together have a cultural significance that’d make me think it’s more about dealing with gender issues than technology.</p> <p>– “The connector” is nice, it’s clever, it doesn’t have any other visual meaning like “The Eye” , it’s colorful and doesn’t have a boring shape, but conversely that makes it hard to memorize as a whole.</p> <p>– “Protocol” is simple, one of the most readable, can be typed easily (Moz://a, bam) which can make it really efficient for communication over websites such as twitter. It’s also easy to remember. While not everyone will get what it means, it will certainly please technology-inclined people, who are those who do proselytism.</p> <p>– I find “Wireframe World” rather bland despite its rather complex and uneven shape. Many people nowadays uses this kind of picture when they want to quickly represent the internet or social networks, it doesn’t say anything about Mozilla. This may as well be some random silicon valley start-up’s logo.</p> <p>– “The Impossible M” has kind of a retro look and rather strong colors, but using an impossible shape is something rather common, and when flattened it just becomes a large M, thus losing all specificity. Moreover, I think its icons look like they’re from Win98, but hey, who knows, maybe design trends will get back there soon :)</p> <p>– “The Flik-Flak” is interesting: a few colors easily associated to firefox’s and geometrical shapes that still create a whole coherent shape, with many possible variations, from complex to simple.</p> <p>Now if I were to rank my preferences:<br>  1° The Protocol and The Flik-Flak: both are original enough (hey, it’s hard to come up with something), look modern enough, don’t have colors that may be hard to integrate in another context, and can as simple or as complex as needed.<br> 2° The Connector: like the two previous ones, but it doesn’t have an easily memorized global shape other than being a colored square, although I recognize it’s clever.<br> 3° The Impossible M: despite what I said, it’s still recognizable enough, but might be hard to simplify into small icons.<br> 4° Wireframe World: cookie-cutter logo.<br> 5° The Eye and Open Button: the weird territory. They both bear too much meaning that have nothing to do with mozilla, namely surveillance and gender issues (no, really, I could totally see the Open Button used by a radical sectarian masculinist group who’d use the blue color to mean how men should dominate that tiny pink stuff at the bottom; I may be over-interpreting, but I can’t shake off how weird it looks).</p>     ",

As an open-source organization, Mozilla believes that transparency and participation prevail over decisions being made out of public view, even decisions made by us. We’re extending this thinking to a new realm with this open design project. We’re learning as we go how to strike the right balance between the voices of our audience and the expertise we have in house at Mozilla and in our brand agency partner johnson banks. Were grateful at the level of community engagement and are drawing lessons from it that will be applied as we move from these initial concepts to the next phase of design. Thanks again for being a part of this effort.</p>     ",

The least-bad (and I use that term on purpose) is probably Protocol, since at least it doesn’t leave me scratching my head.</p> <p>Don’t forget that there is accumulated history here; connecting to that history in some way is a *plus*, not a minus.

Despite some of them being graphically interesting, they’re usability, communication value and durability are very questionable while visually they’re either generic, overly simplified or just visibly “forced” to work. Apart from Route A, the yellow black one. With a few minor tweeks it could be a great system and a very iconic one. It has minor applicability flaws but that’s very solvable, but it’s not just the best one among these, it’s overall great. Different in a good way, that is to say that it steps out of the overly crisp clean and generic design and the bland web product aesthetic and moves into a more graphically engaging one which I thing will be a beneficial factor even to the new users. It shows guts and reliability and has a classic value that it will surely acquire over time.<br> The others I think will fall very very VERY flat as they have zero mnemonic value as such, they’re systems are very uninteresting, forgetable and in some cases horribly banal or in the case of Impossible M, just too trendy. Which you’ll agree isn’t really a great thing considering you’ll probably have to burn another fortune to refresh it in a few years. The moz://a is something I’d buy from 99designs, so is Route G… I believe those two are something a first year design student would think of. That scafolded generic M is just a copy of the Melbourne city identity and Route B is just plain unreadable, and the pattern approach is not something a web product/service should rely on too much. Patterns are very ungreatful for web usage.<br> All in all I don’t think this is a great way of deciding either. Lay people tend to react on emotion but don’t understand the complexity of applying the system and maintainting it. So this overly democratic way of approaching this problem is much like being a high school girl who can’t decide what to wear and asks a bunch of friends, without having an attitude of herown.<br> Still, I vote Route A, it’s great in every way and a brave, involving and friendly way of communicating Mozilla. It says Mozilla visually! And the character is very cute which is gonna be a great asset since people will relate with it better. Also the system is so effortlessly open that it’s gonna be a breeze to apply it to all kinds of stuff.<br> Good luck with it, but despite what people say, test run them all and you’ll see that every one except A will become very very weak in the long run. And you wouldn’t want to change your logo in another few years like DC comics had to.<br> Cheers.</p>     ",

I’ve never seen it quite like this, but maybe I just don’t get around enough…  But I like how this is both an “on” button and a face.  It translates (to me) that it’s open for the people.  </p> <p>I think this logo translates really nicely to black and white, which is a real plus.  It would look really cool on a black or gray t-shirt with the blue part being black and the pink part being white.</p> <p>The MDN bag looks pretty awesome.  I’d buy one of those in a heartbeat.</p> <p>Do I just like everything I see?  No.  I really don’t like any of the other options, tbh.  Wireframe is the next best, perhaps.  But it would need work to make the M really look like an M.  </p> <p>I like the Escher-style “impossible” M, sort of.  The Shape of the M (the outside slants being SO slanted) and the colors used just look weak to me.   Are the colored parts implying I should use “vi” ?</p> <p>So, in short, I think with some iteration on the coloring for Open Button, we’d have a good one there.  I’d just feel more confident if there was a “close second” </p> <p>-Cam</p>     ",
