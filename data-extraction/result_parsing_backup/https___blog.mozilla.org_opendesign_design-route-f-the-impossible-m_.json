Actually, it’s very much possible to achieve our mission, though sometimes it may not look that way.

Yes, Mozilla is from the 90s originally but we need something looking to the future, not the past.</p>     ",

That doesn’t jive well with what I associate Mozilla with.</p> <p>I find the impossible shapes can be a little unsettling, but pulling off the impossible is a fun direction, and I like the message. Paired with vibrant color choices and varying patterns all at once, I get a little overwhelmed. </p> <p>Moz Fest’s color combination turns me off more than others’.<br> The heart logo reminds me of Unilever’s heartbrand, especially if used in Red/Yellow. </p> <p>I do think this direction fits with an IoT and tinker-y image. A little on the fringe and pushing envelopes in under-defined spaces. I have some doubts about how this aesthetic ages, but modest changes could adapt it perhaps.</p>     ",

I like the colors (although they too are very 8-bit) and I like the geometry in an abstract way, as a logo I don’t think it really works. It’s a fun blend of Escher and Lichtenstein, again in an abstract un-related-to-corporate-logo sort of way, but as a major multi-national corporate logo and in terms of inspiring the broad design choices that will need to surround it, it doesn’t work. It’s not evocative of any corporate values or purpose, and what makes it work as pop-art, makes it fail as a corporate logo.</p>     ",
