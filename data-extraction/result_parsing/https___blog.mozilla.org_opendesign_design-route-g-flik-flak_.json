Also there is an origami shape there. The abstract patterns in the backgrounds are a good tesselation and with variations in the colour scheme to perhaps more vivid ones can be more globally oriented.

The Eye of Mozilla reminding us that we have no privacy on the internet makes for poor branding.<br> B: The Connector. This reminds me of the 2012 London Olympics logo. Fun design, looks great on gear but utterly incomprehensible.<br> C: The Open Button. Simple, not dependent on the English language, quickly recognizable. It looks good on gear. The proposed derivative icons for things like Mozfest and the developer network could use some serious work but I think this is the one to go with.<br> D: Protocol. This one is simple and easily recognized . . . and far too geeky. People don’t type protocol:// in front of the address in the 21st century. You will be re-branding again sooner rather than later.<br> E: The Wireframe World. Whatever message it is trying to convey is not getting across. It’s just lines and dots. It too seems pretty geeky to me.<br> F: The Impossible M. I initially liked this one except for the colors but the more I look at it the more I realize why it makes me think of the 70’s. That design scheme would have been right at home on the PBS TV show The Electric Company. If you want that kind of groove, then go for it, man!<br> G: Flik-Flak. This one is my favorite. It is artsy. It reminds you that Firefox is the flagship product, and it looks good on the web site examples and apparel/gear. The simplified “Moz” version is as far as this particular metaphor should go. When you expand it out to the full Mozilla you have to really be looking for it to figure out that it is trying to spell out “Mozilla”.</p>     ",

However, it can be part of the visual language, and used in certain parts of the brand guidelines, while the MOZ and the typeface can be the main logo.</p> <p>One of my favourites alongside The Connector (which I think is the best option here, and the best developed so far). 3rd would be the idea of M:// but not its execution.</p> <p>Really cool option.</p>     ",
